                            <h3>1. Assessment & Preparation</h3>
                            <p>We assess your driveway type and condition, identifying problem areas like oil stains or deep-set dirt. We protect surrounding areas and vegetation before starting.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="step">

                        </div>

                    <h2>Driveway Types We Clean in Surrey</h2>

                    <h3>Block Paving Driveways</h3>
                    <p>Block paving is extremely popular in Redhill, Reigate, Horley, and throughout Surrey. We specialize in cleaning block paved driveways, removing weeds from joints, restoring original colours, and eliminating dark staining. For block paving, we also offer re-sanding and sealing services to protect your investment.</p>

                    <h3>Tarmac & Asphalt Driveways</h3>
                    <p>Tarmac driveways require careful pressure washing to avoid surface damage. Our experienced team uses appropriate pressure settings to clean tarmac effectively, removing oil stains and dirt while preserving the surface integrity.</p>

                    <h3>Concrete Driveways</h3>
                    <p>Concrete driveways are durable but can become badly stained over time. We remove oil stains, tyre marks, and organic growth from concrete surfaces, restoring their clean appearance.</p>

                    <h3>Pattern Imprinted Concrete</h3>
                    <p>Also known as stamped concrete, these decorative driveways need specialist care. We clean pattern imprinted concrete gently to preserve the sealant and pattern while removing dirt and stains.</p>

                    <h2>Common Driveway Problems in Redhill & Reigate</h2>

                    <p>Properties in Surrey face specific driveway cleaning challenges due to our climate and environment:</p>

                    <ul class="problems-list">
                        <li><strong>Oil Stains</strong> - Vehicle leaks create stubborn dark patches that regular cleaning can't remove</li>
                        <li><strong>Moss & Algae Growth</strong> - Our damp climate encourages green organic growth, especially in shaded areas</li>
                        <li><strong>Block Paving Weeds</strong> - Weeds growing between blocks create an unkempt appearance</li>
                        <li><strong>Dark Staining</strong> - Black spots and general discolouration from organic matter</li>
                        <li><strong>Tyre Marks</strong> - Rubber deposits that build up over time</li>
                        <li><strong>General Dirt Accumulation</strong> - Traffic film, leaf stains, and everyday grime</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Our professional driveway cleaning service addresses all these issues, restoring your driveway's appearance regardless of its current condition.</p>
