# Software Opportunity Research - Systematic Analysis

**Research Date:** January 2026
**Objective:** Find a viable software opportunity with $1K+ MRR potential
**Key Insight:** SaaS niches are crowded because everyone searches for them. Better opportunities are in serving people who don't usually use software.

---

## Executive Summary

After 3 rounds of research covering 100+ niches, we found that **traditional SaaS research fails** because:
1. Every "underserved" niche has FREE well-funded competitors
2. Everyone searches the same "micro-SaaS ideas" articles
3. SEO is blocked by incumbents and aggregators

**The winning approach:** Find people who don't search for software - they complain about problems in communities.

## FINAL TOP 3 ANALYSIS (In-Depth)

### #1: Sewing/Quilting Pattern Manager — BEST OVERALL

**Why it's the best opportunity:**
- **2.1 MILLION members** on r/sewing alone
- Existing apps **crash and lose data** - users explicitly frustrated
- "Nothing good available on Android" — massive platform gap
- "You have to enter every pattern manually. ONE BY ONE"
- High Etsy template sales prove willingness to pay

**Strategic advantages:**
1. **Demographics are ideal** — Quilters/sewers tend to be older women with disposable income. Not hunting for free alternatives; they just want something that works. Low churn, high lifetime value.
2. **Pain is extreme, bar is low** — Differentiation is "doesn't crash" — achievable.
3. **Lifelong hobby** — People quilt for 30+ years. Not a trend. Natural high retention.
4. **No platform risk** — No dominant player who could fix their product and crush you.
5. **Pricing flexibility** — Quilters prefer one-time purchases ($79 lifetime). Rare and valuable — cash upfront.

**The gap to fill:**
- Cross-device sync that actually works
- Barcode/cover scanning for quick pattern entry
- Offline mode for fabric store visits
- One-time purchase option (no subscriptions)

**Where to reach them:**
- r/sewing (2.1M), r/quilting, r/SewingForBeginners (184K)
- PatternReview.com forums
- Sewing Facebook groups

**Pricing:** $29/year or $4.99/month or $79 lifetime

**Main challenge:** Building reliable cross-platform sync with offline mode is non-trivial. But it's a known technical problem, not an unknown market problem.

---

### #2: Funko Pop Collection Tracker — FASTEST TO VALIDATE

**Why it's excellent:**
- **Official Funko app is broken** - crashes, loses data, login issues for YEARS
- HobbyDB (Pop Price Guide) now paywalled and frustrating
- MASSIVE passionate community (Funko is $1B+ company)
- Clear pain point: "I just want something that works"

**Strategic advantages:**
1. **Quickest build** — 4-6 weeks to MVP. Core feature is just "track your collection without crashing."
2. **Obvious monetization** — Free tracking, $5-10/month for price alerts and valuation.
3. **Passionate users** — Collectors are obsessive. They'll pay for tools that work.

**Why it's #2 not #1:**
1. **Funko could fix their app** — They haven't in years, but they could.
2. **Pricing data is hard** — Getting reliable, real-time pricing is the actual product. eBay sold listings API, market data aggregation is where the work is.
3. **Trend risk** — Funko popularity could decline. Collecting hobbies are cyclical.

**The gap to fill:**
- An app that doesn't crash
- Accurate, real-time pricing
- Working collection sharing
- Want list with price alerts

**Where to reach them:**
- Funko Funatic forums
- Funko collector Facebook groups
- Reddit r/funkopop

**Pricing:** Free tracking, $5-10/month for pricing/alerts

---

### #3: Scout Troop Management — CLEAREST PAIN, MOST RISK

**Why it's interesting:**
- **Scoutbook is universally hated** - documented on Scouting Forums
- "Scoutbook is unusably slow"
- "A poorly designed website, very confusing, NOT intuitive at all"
- Leaders are "leaving the program not wanting to deal with it anymore"
- BSA bankruptcy created support vacuum - they can't fix it

**Why it's #3 (risks):**
1. **BSA is declining** — Membership has dropped significantly. Market is shrinking.
2. **Volunteer turnover = churn** — Leaders rotate out every few years. Lose customers because they quit scouting.
3. **Must sync with Scoutbook** — Can't replace it (official record). Must supplement it = integration with terrible system.
4. **Domain complexity** — Merit badge requirements, rank advancement rules, camping regulations.

**The gap to fill:**
- Mobile-first advancement tracking
- Simple event scheduling with RSVP
- Parent notifications that actually work
- Sync with Scoutbook (don't replace, supplement)

**Where to reach them:**
- discussions.scouting.org (official BSA forums)
- Scout leader Facebook groups
- Council/district roundtable meetings

**Pricing:** $8-15/month (~$100-180/year) - troops have fundraising

---

### #4: Self-Managed HOA Software (Under 50 Units)

**Why it's excellent:**
- 27-30% of HOAs are self-managed
- Current solutions start at $39-49/month - too expensive
- "Before HOAworks, we felt like we were constantly playing catch-up - outdated spreadsheets"
- Violation tracking alone used to take 60-70 hours/week for some boards

**The gap:**
- Simple dues tracking with online payment
- Violation tracking with photo upload
- Document storage
- Under $25/month pricing

**Where to reach them:**
- HOATalk.com (45,000+ members)
- r/HOA
- HOAManagement.com forum

**Pricing:** $15-25/month (undercut $39+ competitors)

---

### #5: Estate Sale Company Software

**Why it's excellent:**
- 28% work alone, 20% have 1-2 employees - tiny operations
- 55% do NOT conduct any sales online - very low tech adoption
- No clear dominant player
- Massive pain: cataloging and pricing hundreds of items manually

**The gap:**
- Mobile app for photographing items + AI-suggested pricing
- Basic inventory tracking with labels
- End-of-sale reporting for families

**Where to reach them:**
- Estate Sale Company Network (Facebook)
- EstateSales.org community
- Antique/collectible dealer groups

**Pricing:** $30-50/month (undercuts established players)

## Key Strategic Insights

### Why Traditional SaaS Research Fails
1. **FREE competitors everywhere** - VCs subsidize free tiers for market share
2. **Everyone searching same places** - "micro-SaaS ideas" articles are traps
3. **SEO is blocked** - Incumbents + aggregators own all keywords
4. **Features, not products** - Most "niches" are just features of bigger platforms

### How to Find Real Opportunities
1. **Search for problems, not software** - "X is frustrating" not "software for X"
2. **Mine templates** - Etsy/Gumroad templates = manual processes to automate
3. **Find broken software** - Apps that crash, services that shut down
4. **Look at offline people** - They complain in Facebook groups, not Google
5. **Check subreddits** - Real complaints with engagement = real pain

### Winning Characteristics
1. **Existing solutions are BROKEN** (not just "missing")
2. **Active community you can reach** (Reddit, Facebook, forums)
3. **NO well-funded free competitor**
4. **Users already spend money** on the hobby/activity
5. **Multi-year retention** (not annual volunteer turnover)

## SKEPTICAL VALIDATION: Top 2 Opportunities

### Critical Finding: BOTH TOP OPPORTUNITIES FAILED VALIDATION

After comprehensive skeptical research, both top opportunities reveal fundamental flaws.

---

### Sewing/Quilting Pattern Manager — FAILED (3/10)

**What the skeptical research found:**

**1. Market Already Solved with FREE Tools**
- **Threadloop** - FREE web app, 79,680 patterns in database, unlimited stash entries, cross-device sync, praised by users
- **PopGrinder** equivalent: Users explicitly state they prefer Threadloop over paid alternatives
- **Stash Hub** - 14,000+ active users, established player
- **Electric Quilt 8** - $239.95 for serious quilters, market leader
- Multiple free apps exist and work well

**2. Failed Precedent**
- **Pattern-File** shut down despite being focused on this exact niche
- CEO admitted: "Pattern File is the perfect example of how NOT to launch and support an app. Especially for the fee they charged."
- Users switched to free alternatives (Evernote, Trello, Threadloop)

**3. Demographic Reality**
- 62% of sewers are 45+ years old (less likely to adopt new apps)
- Fabric/sewing supplies industry declining at -1.4% CAGR
- Users prefer free tools and spreadsheets

**4. Technical Challenges**
- Barcode scanning doesn't work for indie patterns (majority of Etsy market)
- Only commercial patterns (McCall's, Simplicity) have barcodes
- Manual data entry = user abandonment

**5. Conversion Math Impossible**
- Freemium converts at 2-5%
- If 1-2% of 30M sewers try app = 300-600K potential users
- At 2-5% conversion = 6-30K paying customers
- At $79 lifetime = $474K-$2.37M MAXIMUM lifetime revenue
- Development + marketing costs eat most of this

**Verdict: FAILED — Threadloop (free) already solves this. Pattern-File tried and failed. Zero switching motivation.**

---

### Funko Pop Collection Tracker — FAILED (3/10)

**What the skeptical research found:**

**1. FREE Competitors Already Winning**
- **PopGrinder** - FREE, barcode scanner, auto-valuation, users explicitly switched FROM paid alternatives TO this
- **PriceCharting** - Launched November 2024, 100% FREE, daily pricing updates, comprehensive database
- **The Pop Directory** - FREE, one of most used apps by collectors
- Quote: "Once PopPriceGuide became HobbyDB and a paid experience, I refuse to use it. I use PopGrinder now."

**2. Pricing Data is Legally/Technically Blocked**
- eBay ToS explicitly prohibits scraping
- eBay API has rate limits (5,000/day) - need 34,000+ calls for daily updates
- Legal precedent: eBay vs. Bidder's Edge (2000) - eBay sued and won
- Every working solution has commercial relationships you can't replicate

**3. Funko Company in Financial Distress**
- Q2 2025: Revenue -21.9% decline ($193.5M vs $247.7M)
- Net loss: -$41.0M (vs +$5.4M profit prior year)
- 20% global workforce reduction announced
- Tariff uncertainty causing chaos
- Market is CONTRACTING, not growing

**4. Monetization Already Failed**
- HobbyDB/Pop Price Guide moved to paid model
- Users fled to FREE PopGrinder and PriceCharting
- This proves: When you paywall, users leave for free alternatives
- Freemium converts at 2-5% — not sustainable

**5. Funko's Own App (6 Years, Still Broken)**
- Funko acquired Stashpedia in 2019
- After 6 years with full resources, app is WORSE
- Collection sharing "hasn't worked for years"
- If Funko can't build this with unlimited resources, can you?

**Verdict: FAILED — PopGrinder (free) already exists. Pricing data is legally blocked. Market is contracting. HobbyDB proved paywall = users flee.**

---

### What This Means

Both "top opportunities" failed under skeptical scrutiny because:

1. **FREE well-funded alternatives exist** that users explicitly prefer
2. **Failed precedents exist** — Pattern-File, HobbyDB paywall exodus
3. **Markets are contracting** — Sewing -1.4% CAGR, Funko -21.9% revenue
4. **Technical barriers** — Pricing data legally blocked, barcode doesn't cover indie patterns

### The Pattern

Every "underserved niche" we've researched has the same pattern:
- Initial research shows "broken existing solutions"
- Deeper research reveals FREE alternatives that work
- Users explicitly prefer free over paid
- Previous attempts to monetize failed

### Implications

The remaining opportunities (#3-#10) likely have similar hidden flaws. The research methodology that found these opportunities (community complaints) may be fundamentally flawed because:

1. Complaints ≠ willingness to pay
2. "Broken" official apps ≠ no working alternatives
3. Large communities ≠ monetizable audience
4. Template sales ≠ app adoption

### What Actually Works

Based on all research, viable opportunities seem to require:
- **B2B, not B2C** — businesses pay, consumers use free tools
- **Truly no free alternative** — not just "official app broken"
- **Growing market** — not declining (-1.4%, -21.9%)
- **No platform dependency** — can't be crushed by incumbent fixing their app
- **Recurring revenue necessity** — data/reports they can't live without

---

## STRATEGIC PIVOT: Solo Business Software (B2B Micro-Niches)

### Why B2C Failed, Why B2B Might Work

| B2C (Hobbyists) - FAILED | B2B (Solo Businesses) - NEW APPROACH |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Hunt for free tools | Business expense = budget exists |
| Time is free | Time is money = will pay to save time |
| No consequences for free | Tax deductible, easier to justify |
| Can use hobby-grade tools | Need professional-grade tools |
| Complaints ≠ willingness to pay | Already paying = proven willingness |

### The Target: Solo Operators in Ignored Niches

**Ideal characteristics:**
1. **Old, established software** that hasn't been updated in years
2. **Expensive legacy pricing** ($50-200/month when should be $20-30)
3. **Desktop-only** when mobile work is essential
4. **No modern features** (no cloud sync, bad UX, no integrations)
5. **Captive audience** - they HAVE to use something
6. **Low competition** - big SaaS ignores because market is "too small"

### Categories to Research

**1. Niche Professionals with Specific Software Needs**
- Notaries (journal, scheduling, mobile signings)
- Process servers (tracking, GPS proof, affidavits)
- Home inspectors (reports, photos, checklists)
- Appraisers (real estate, auto, jewelry, antiques)
- Court reporters (transcription, invoicing)
- Arborists/tree service (estimates, compliance)
- Surveyors (field data, reports)

**2. Mobile Service Trades**
- Mobile mechanics
- Appliance repair
- Locksmiths
- Pool service
- Pest control
- Mobile car detailers
- Carpet/window cleaners

**3. Appointment-Based Solo Services**
- Massage therapists
- Personal trainers
- Music teachers
- Dog groomers
- Photographers/videographers

**4. Small-Scale Asset Management**
- Small landlords (1-10 units)
- Vacation rental hosts
- Storage unit owners
- Boat/RV storage operators

### Research Signals to Find

- "Last updated 2018" or older
- Pricing: $50+/month for simple features
- "No mobile app" when mobile is essential
- Desktop-only in mobile-first workflows
- Reviews: "clunky," "outdated," "overpriced"
- "Too expensive for what it does"
- Industry-specific software that's been ignored
