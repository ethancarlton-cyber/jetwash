# Software Opportunity Research - Systematic Analysis

**Research Date:** January 2026
**Objective:** Find a viable software opportunity with $1K+ MRR potential
**Key Insight:** SaaS niches are crowded because everyone searches for them. Better opportunities are in serving people who don't usually use software.

---

## Executive Summary

After 3 rounds of research covering 100+ niches, we found that **traditional SaaS research fails** because:
1. Every "underserved" niche has FREE well-funded competitors
2. Everyone searches the same "micro-SaaS ideas" articles
3. SEO is blocked by incumbents and aggregators

**The winning approach:** Find people who don't search for software - they complain about problems in communities.

## Key Strategic Insights

### Why Traditional SaaS Research Fails
1. **FREE competitors everywhere** - VCs subsidize free tiers for market share
2. **Everyone searching same places** - "micro-SaaS ideas" articles are traps
3. **SEO is blocked** - Incumbents + aggregators own all keywords
4. **Features, not products** - Most "niches" are just features of bigger platforms

### How to Find Real Opportunities
1. **Search for problems, not software** - "X is frustrating" not "software for X"
2. **Mine templates** - Etsy/Gumroad templates = manual processes to automate
3. **Find broken software** - Apps that crash, services that shut down
4. **Look at offline people** - They complain in Facebook groups, not Google
5. **Check subreddits** - Real complaints with engagement = real pain

### Winning Characteristics
1. **Existing solutions are BROKEN** (not just "missing")
2. **Active community you can reach** (Reddit, Facebook, forums)
3. **NO well-funded free competitor**
4. **Users already spend money** on the hobby/activity
5. **Multi-year retention** (not annual volunteer turnover)
