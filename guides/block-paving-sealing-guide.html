            <p><strong>The quick answer:</strong> Sealing block paving costs <strong>£3-8 per square metre</strong> (£120-320 for a typical 40sqm driveway) and lasts <strong>3-5 years</strong>. It's optional but worthwhile if you have problems with ants, weeds, or oil stains, or simply want your driveway to stay cleaner longer.</p>

            <p>This guide covers everything you need to know about block paving sealing - what it does, the different types, costs, and whether it's right for your driveway.</p>

            <h2>What Does Block Paving Sealer Actually Do?</h2>

            <p>Block paving sealer creates a protective layer over the blocks and, critically, binds the sand in the joints. Here's what it achieves:</p>

            <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stops ants and insects:</strong> Ants love nesting in kiln-dried sand joints. Sealer locks the sand in place, making it impossible for them to burrow. This is the number one reason customers choose sealing.</li>
                <li><strong>Prevents weed growth:</strong> Seeds can't germinate in sealed joints. Existing weeds must be removed before sealing - sealer won't kill them.</li>
                <li><strong>Makes oil stains easier to clean:</strong> Oil sits on the sealed surface rather than penetrating the blocks. Fresh spills can be wiped away.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduces moss and algae:</strong> Sealed surfaces don't hold moisture as readily, slowing biological growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhances appearance:</strong> Depending on the sealer type, colours can be enhanced and the surface given a subtle sheen.</li>
                <li><strong>Stabilises sand:</strong> Joints stay full rather than washing away in rain or being disturbed by traffic.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Sealing Doesn't Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Doesn't make old paving look new:</strong> Sealer locks in whatever's there. Dirty or faded paving will look dirty and faded under sealer.</li>
                <li><strong>Doesn't fix damaged blocks:</strong> Cracked, chipped or sunken blocks need repairing before sealing.</li>
                <li><strong>Doesn't last forever:</strong> Expect 3-5 years before resealing is needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Doesn't eliminate cleaning:</strong> Sealed surfaces still need washing, just less frequently.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Block Paving Sealer</h2>

            <h3>Wet Look Sealer</h3>
            <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Glossy, darkens colours, looks like the paving is permanently wet.</p>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Red, orange and buff blocks where you want enhanced colour. Popular for driveways.</p>
            <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Shows tyre marks more easily. Can look artificial on some paving. Very glossy finishes can be slippery when wet (look for anti-slip versions).</p>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £4-6 per sqm applied.</p>

            <h3>Matte/Invisible Sealer</h3>
            <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> No visible change - the paving looks natural but has protection.</p>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Natural stone effect blocks, grey paving, or anyone who doesn't want a glossy look.</p>
            <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Still provides all the protection but without colour enhancement. Good choice if you're unsure.</p>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £3-5 per sqm applied.</p>

            <h3>Colour Enhancing Sealer</h3>
            <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Deepens and enriches faded colours without heavy gloss.</p>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Older paving that's faded over the years. Brings back some of the original colour.</p>
            <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Results vary depending on how faded the original paving is. Won't restore heavily worn blocks.</p>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £4-7 per sqm applied.</p>

            <h3>Solvent-Based vs Water-Based</h3>
            <p><strong>Solvent-based:</strong> Penetrates deeper, more durable, stronger smell during application, longer drying time. Generally considered higher performance.</p>
            <p><strong>Water-based:</strong> Lower odour, faster drying, easier to apply, more environmentally friendly. Good for occupied properties where smell is a concern.</p>

            <h2>Block Paving Sealing Costs (2025 UK Prices)</h2>

            <h3>Professional Application Costs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sealing only:</strong> £3-8 per sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Typical 40sqm driveway:</strong> £120-320</li>
                <li><strong>Typical 60sqm driveway:</strong> £180-480</li>
                <li><strong>Small 20sqm patio:</strong> £80-160</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Affects the Price?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type of sealer:</strong> Wet look and colour enhancing cost more than matte</li>
                <li><strong>Number of coats:</strong> Some sealers need two coats for best results</li>
                <li><strong>Condition of paving:</strong> More prep work = higher cost</li>
                <li><strong>Size of area:</strong> Larger areas have lower per-sqm costs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cleaning + Sealing Packages</h3>
            <p>Most sealing is done immediately after professional cleaning. Package prices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clean only:</strong> £3-6 per sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Clean + matte seal:</strong> £6-10 per sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Clean + wet look seal:</strong> £7-12 per sqm</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For a 40sqm driveway, cleaning and sealing together typically costs £280-480.</p>

            <h2>How Long Does Sealer Last?</h2>

            <p>Expect quality block paving sealer to last:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Driveways (regular traffic):</strong> 3-4 years</li>
                <li><strong>Patios (foot traffic only):</strong> 4-5 years</li>
                <li><strong>High-traffic areas:</strong> 2-3 years</li>
                <li><strong>Wheel tracks specifically:</strong> 2-3 years (wear faster than rest of driveway)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Factors That Reduce Lifespan</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Heavy vehicle traffic</li>
                <li>Power steering turning on the spot</li>
                <li>Direct sunlight (UV degradation)</li>
                <li>Poor initial cleaning before sealing</li>
                <li>Low-quality sealer products</li>
                <li>Application when too cold or damp</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Sealing Process: What to Expect</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Professional Cleaning</h3>
            <p>The paving must be thoroughly pressure washed to remove all dirt, moss, algae and old failed sealer. This typically takes 2-4 hours for a driveway.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Re-Sanding</h3>
            <p>Kiln-dried sand is swept into all joints. This must be done before sealing - the sealer binds this sand in place.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Drying Time</h3>
            <p>The paving must be completely dry before sealing. Minimum 24-48 hours in dry weather. Sealing damp paving causes white hazing.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Sealer Application</h3>
            <p>Sealer is applied by low-pressure sprayer or roller. Even, consistent coverage is essential. Most sealers need 2 coats for durability.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Curing</h3>
            <p>Keep off the paving for 24 hours minimum. Full cure takes 48-72 hours. No vehicles for at least 48 hours.</p>

            <h2>Can I Seal Block Paving Myself?</h2>

            <p>DIY sealing is possible but the most common cause of sealer failure is inadequate preparation:</p>

            <h3>DIY Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properly cleaned paving:</strong> Professional pressure washing recommended</li>
                <li><strong>Re-sanded joints:</strong> Kiln-dried sand only (not builders sand)</li>
                <li><strong>Bone dry surface:</strong> 48 hours minimum dry weather before sealing</li>
                <li><strong>Quality sealer:</strong> £60-120 for 40sqm (don't buy cheap unbranded products)</li>
                <li><strong>Low-pressure sprayer or roller:</strong> £20-50</li>
                <li><strong>Dry weather forecast:</strong> No rain for 24-48 hours after application</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common DIY Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sealing over dirt:</strong> Locks in staining permanently</li>
                <li><strong>Sealing when damp:</strong> Causes white cloudy patches that can't be removed</li>
                <li><strong>Uneven application:</strong> Creates blotchy appearance</li>
                <li><strong>Cheap sealer:</strong> Yellows, peels, and fails within months</li>
                <li><strong>Wrong type for surface:</strong> Some sealers aren't compatible with certain blocks</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Is Block Paving Sealing Worth It?</h2>

            <h3>Sealing Is Worth It If:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You have ant problems in your driveway</li>
                <li>Weeds keep growing despite removing them</li>
                <li>You park vehicles that might drip oil</li>
                <li>You want to reduce cleaning frequency</li>
                <li>You like the wet look appearance</li>
                <li>Your paving is in good condition and you want to keep it that way</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sealing May Not Be Worth It If:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your paving is old and heavily worn</li>
                <li>There's significant damage needing repair first</li>
                <li>You have no ant or weed problems</li>
                <li>Budget is very tight (cleaning alone still helps)</li>
                <li>The paving is in heavy shade (less sun means slower sealer degradation anyway)</li>
            </ul>
