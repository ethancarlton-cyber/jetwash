            <p><strong>In the UK, pressure washing and jet washing are essentially the same thing.</strong> Both terms describe the process of using high-pressure water to clean outdoor surfaces such as driveways, patios, decking, and walls. The terminology simply varies by region and personal preference, with "jet washing" being more commonly used in Britain, whilst "pressure washing" is the predominant term in North America and technical contexts.</p>

            <p>If you've been searching for exterior cleaning services, you may have noticed both terms appearing in your results. Understanding what each means—and whether there's any practical difference—can help you make informed decisions when hiring a professional cleaning service or purchasing equipment for DIY projects.</p>

            <h2>What Is Pressure Washing?</h2>

            <p>Pressure washing refers to the use of mechanically pressurised water to remove dirt, grime, mould, algae, and other contaminants from hard surfaces. The equipment typically consists of a motorised pump that increases water pressure significantly beyond what a standard garden hose can achieve.</p>

            <h3>How Pressure Washing Works</h3>

            <p>A pressure washer draws water from a mains supply or water tank and forces it through a concentrated nozzle at high pressure. This pressure is measured in bars or PSI (pounds per square inch). Domestic pressure washers typically operate between 100-150 bars, whilst commercial units can exceed 200 bars.</p>

            <p>The high-pressure stream effectively blasts away:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accumulated dirt and mud</li>
                <li>Green algae and moss</li>
                <li>Oil and grease stains</li>
                <li>Mildew and mould</li>
                <li>Chewing gum and paint residue</li>
                <li>Bird droppings</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Is Jet Washing?</h2>

            <p>Jet washing is the British colloquial term for exactly the same cleaning process. The name derives from the powerful "jet" of water that emerges from the machine's lance or wand. In everyday UK conversation, you're far more likely to hear someone say they need their driveway jet washed rather than pressure washed.</p>

            <h3>The Origins of the Term</h3>

            <p>The phrase "jet washing" became popular in the UK partly due to branding. Several leading manufacturers marketed their machines as "jet washers," and the terminology stuck in common parlance. Much like how we often say "hoover" instead of "vacuum cleaner," jet washing has become the default British term for high-pressure water cleaning.</p>
