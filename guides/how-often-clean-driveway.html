            <p><strong>The quick answer:</strong> Most UK driveways benefit from professional cleaning every <strong>1-2 years</strong>. However, this varies significantly based on your location, how much shade your driveway gets, the material it's made from, and how much traffic it sees.</p>

            <p>In this guide, we'll explain exactly how to determine the right cleaning schedule for your specific driveway, the warning signs that it's time to clean, and how to make your clean last longer.</p>

            <h2>Factors That Affect How Often You Need to Clean</h2>

            <p>No two driveways are the same. Here are the key factors that determine your cleaning frequency:</p>

            <h3>1. Shade and Sun Exposure</h3>
            <p>This is the biggest factor. Driveways in heavy shade (under trees or north-facing) accumulate moss and algae much faster than sunny driveways. A shaded driveway in Surrey might need cleaning every 12 months, while a sunny south-facing driveway could last 2-3 years.</p>

            <h3>2. Local Climate</h3>
            <p>The UK's wet climate encourages biological growth. Surrey and the South East get around 700mm of rainfall annually - less than the west of England (1000mm+) but enough to support rapid moss growth. If you're in a particularly damp area or near woodland, expect to clean more frequently.</p>

            <h3>3. Driveway Material</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Block paving:</strong> Every 1-2 years. Moss grows in the joints and can lift blocks if left too long.</li>
                <li><strong>Tarmac:</strong> Every 1-2 years. Shows dirt easily but cleans up well.</li>
                <li><strong>Concrete:</strong> Every 2-3 years. Porous surface stains over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Resin bound:</strong> Every 2-3 years. Smooth surface resists moss better than block paving.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural stone:</strong> Every 1-2 years. Porous stones like sandstone stain faster than granite.</li>
                <li><strong>Gravel:</strong> Rarely needs pressure washing - occasional raking and weed treatment instead.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Traffic and Use</h3>
            <p>Heavy vehicle traffic compacts dirt into the surface. If you have multiple cars, regular deliveries, or use your driveway for parking work vehicles, you'll need more frequent cleaning.</p>

            <h3>5. Nearby Trees</h3>
            <p>Trees drop leaves, sap, and pollen. Oak trees are particularly problematic - their tannins stain concrete and stone. If your driveway is under trees, budget for annual cleaning.</p>

            <h2>Signs Your Driveway Needs Cleaning</h2>

            <p>Don't wait for a schedule - watch for these warning signs:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green or black discolouration</strong> - Algae (green) and black spot lichen are the most common issues in the UK.</li>
                <li><strong>Slippery when wet</strong> - Algae creates a slippery film that's a genuine safety hazard, especially in winter.</li>
                <li><strong>Visible moss in joints</strong> - On block paving, moss in the joints eventually lifts and loosens blocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed growth</strong> - Weeds exploit gaps where jointing sand has washed away.</li>
                <li><strong>Oil stains spreading</strong> - Fresh oil is easier to remove. Old oil penetrates deeper and becomes permanent.</li>
                <li><strong>White salt deposits</strong> - Efflorescence (white mineral deposits) on block paving needs professional treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Faded, dull appearance</strong> - Compare to a clean patch under a plant pot. If the difference is dramatic, it's time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cleaning Frequency by Driveway Type</h2>

            <h3>Block Paving Driveways</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended:</strong> Every 12-18 months</p>
            <p>Block paving has joints that trap organic matter and moisture - perfect conditions for moss. Left too long, moss roots can actually lift blocks, requiring expensive re-laying. Professional cleaning includes re-sanding the joints with kiln-dried sand, which helps prevent weed and moss regrowth.</p>

            <h3>Tarmac Driveways</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended:</strong> Every 12-24 months</p>
            <p>Tarmac is relatively low-maintenance but does accumulate algae and oil stains. Regular cleaning prevents the black surface turning grey-green. Avoid very high pressure on old tarmac as it can damage the surface.</p>

            <h3>Concrete Driveways</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended:</strong> Every 18-24 months</p>
            <p>Concrete is porous and absorbs stains over time. Regular cleaning prevents permanent discolouration. Older concrete may benefit from sealing after cleaning to reduce future staining.</p>

            <h3>Resin Bound Driveways</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended:</strong> Every 24-36 months</p>
            <p>Resin driveways have a smooth, non-porous surface that resists moss and algae better than other materials. They're the lowest maintenance option but still benefit from occasional professional cleaning to maintain appearance.</p>

            <h3>Natural Stone Driveways</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended:</strong> Every 12-18 months</p>
            <p>Natural stone varies hugely. Porous Indian sandstone stains quickly and needs frequent cleaning. Dense granite is more resistant. Always use appropriate pressure - high pressure can damage softer stones.</p>

            <h2>How to Make Your Clean Last Longer</h2>

            <p>Professional cleaning costs money, so here's how to extend the time between cleans:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Remove leaves promptly</strong> - Leaves trap moisture and decompose into the surface. Sweep or blow them away weekly in autumn.</li>
                <li><strong>Treat moss early</strong> - A simple moss killer applied in spring can prevent small patches becoming major problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Fix drainage issues</strong> - Standing water accelerates algae growth. Ensure your driveway drains properly.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider sealing</strong> - Sealed block paving resists staining and moss for 3-5 years. The upfront cost pays off in reduced cleaning frequency.</li>
                <li><strong>Deal with oil immediately</strong> - Fresh oil can be absorbed with cat litter and cleaned with washing up liquid. Old oil requires professional treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Trim overhanging branches</strong> - More sun exposure means slower algae growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>DIY vs Professional Cleaning</h2>

            <p>Can you clean your driveway yourself? Yes, but there are trade-offs:</p>

            <h3>DIY Cleaning Works For:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Light surface dirt on small areas</li>
                <li>Regular maintenance between professional cleans</li>
                <li>Homeowners with quality pressure washers (2000+ PSI)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Professional Cleaning Is Better For:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Heavily soiled driveways with years of buildup</li>
                <li>Block paving needing re-sanding</li>
                <li>Delicate surfaces like natural stone or old concrete</li>
                <li>Large driveways (professional equipment is 3-5x faster)</li>
                <li>Driveways with oil stains or stubborn lichen</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Professional machines operate at 3000-4000 PSI with heated water and rotary surface cleaners. They achieve results that domestic equipment simply can't match, without the risk of damage from incorrect technique.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>For most UK homeowners, <strong>professional driveway cleaning every 1-2 years</strong> keeps driveways looking good and prevents long-term damage. If your driveway is shaded, under trees, or made of block paving, lean towards annual cleaning. If it's sunny, well-drained, and made of resin or modern concrete, you might stretch to every 2-3 years.</p>

            <p>The cost of professional cleaning (typically £3-6 per square metre) is far less than repairing damage from neglected moss growth or replacing stained surfaces. Think of it as maintenance that protects your investment.</p>
