            <p><strong>The quick answer:</strong> Professional driveway cleaning in the UK costs <strong>£3-6 per square metre</strong> in 2025. A typical single-car driveway (25sqm) costs <strong>£80-150</strong>. A double driveway (50sqm) costs <strong>£150-300</strong>. Prices include high-pressure cleaning and, for block paving, re-sanding of joints.</p>

            <p>This guide breaks down exactly what affects pricing, what's included, and how to get the best value for your money.</p>

            <h2>Driveway Cleaning Prices by Size</h2>

            <h3>Small Driveway (15-25 sqm)</h3>
            <p>Typical: Single car space, terraced house</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic clean:</strong> £60-100</li>
                <li><strong>With re-sanding:</strong> £80-120</li>
                <li><strong>With sealing:</strong> £140-200</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Medium Driveway (25-45 sqm)</h3>
            <p>Typical: Two-car driveway, semi-detached house</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic clean:</strong> £100-180</li>
                <li><strong>With re-sanding:</strong> £120-200</li>
                <li><strong>With sealing:</strong> £200-350</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Large Driveway (45-70 sqm)</h3>
            <p>Typical: Three-car driveway, detached house</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic clean:</strong> £150-280</li>
                <li><strong>With re-sanding:</strong> £180-320</li>
                <li><strong>With sealing:</strong> £300-500</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Extra Large Driveway (70+ sqm)</h3>
            <p>Typical: Large detached, multiple vehicles, turning areas</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic clean:</strong> £250-450</li>
                <li><strong>With re-sanding:</strong> £300-500</li>
                <li><strong>With sealing:</strong> £450-700+</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Prices by Driveway Material</h2>

            <h3>Block Paving</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £3.50-6 per sqm</p>
            <p>Block paving is the most common driveway type and costs slightly more because joints need re-sanding with kiln-dried sand after cleaning. The sand stabilises blocks, prevents weeds, and discourages ants.</p>

            <h3>Tarmac/Asphalt</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £2.50-4 per sqm</p>
            <p>Tarmac is generally the cheapest to clean - no joints mean no re-sanding. However, very old tarmac needs lower pressure to avoid surface damage.</p>

            <h3>Concrete</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £3-5 per sqm</p>
            <p>Concrete driveways clean well but may need pre-treatment for oil stains. Older concrete can be porous and may benefit from sealing after cleaning.</p>

            <h3>Natural Stone</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £4-7 per sqm</p>
            <p>Natural stone (sandstone, granite, slate) requires more care. Softer stones like sandstone need lower pressure and may take longer. Granite is more robust.</p>

            <h3>Resin Bound</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £3-5 per sqm</p>
            <p>Resin driveways are relatively easy to clean and stay cleaner longer. No joints mean no re-sanding required.</p>

            <h2>What's Included in the Price?</h2>

            <h3>Standard Cleaning Includes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-treatment:</strong> Application of moss/algae killer before pressure washing</li>
                <li><strong>High-pressure cleaning:</strong> Professional 3000+ PSI equipment with hot water</li>
                <li><strong>Rotary surface cleaning:</strong> Industrial rotary cleaners for even, streak-free results</li>
                <li><strong>Edge detailing:</strong> Hand cleaning of edges, corners, and around obstacles</li>
                <li><strong>Re-sanding (block paving):</strong> Kiln-dried sand swept into all joints</li>
                <li><strong>Debris removal:</strong> Cleaning up and removing any debris created</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Usually Extra:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oil stain treatment:</strong> £10-30 per stain depending on size and age</li>
                <li><strong>Sealing:</strong> £3-8 per sqm additional</li>
                <li><strong>Weed treatment:</strong> £15-40 if significant weed growth</li>
                <li><strong>Moss treatment:</strong> £20-50 for heavy moss removal</li>
                <li><strong>Efflorescence treatment:</strong> £30-60 for white salt staining on block paving</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Factors That Affect Price</h2>

            <h3>1. Condition of the Driveway</h3>
            <p>A lightly soiled driveway that was cleaned last year takes less time than one with 5 years of moss buildup. Heavy soiling can add 20-30% to the price.</p>

            <h3>2. Access</h3>
            <p>Easy access (equipment can park on or next to the driveway) keeps costs down. Difficult access - carrying equipment through the house, up slopes, or far from water supply - adds time and cost.</p>

            <h3>3. Location</h3>
            <p>Prices are higher in London and the South East (£4-7 per sqm) compared to the North (£2.50-4.50 per sqm). Surrey prices typically sit at £3-6 per sqm.</p>

            <h3>4. Time of Year</h3>
            <p>Spring is peak season - prices may be slightly higher and availability limited. Winter is quieter but weather can delay jobs.</p>

            <h3>5. Additional Areas</h3>
            <p>Combining driveway cleaning with patio, paths, or walls often gets a better per-sqm rate than booking separately.</p>

            <h2>How to Calculate Your Driveway Size</h2>

            <p>To estimate your cost, you need your driveway's size in square metres:</p>

            <h3>Simple Rectangle</h3>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Length (m) x Width (m) = Square metres</p>
            <p>Example: 8m long x 4m wide = 32 square metres</p>

            <h3>L-Shaped or Irregular</h3>
            <p>Break it into rectangles, calculate each, and add together.</p>

            <h3>Common Sizes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single car space:</strong> 15-25 sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Double width:</strong> 35-50 sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Large family driveway:</strong> 50-80 sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Large with turning area:</strong> 80-120 sqm</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Is Professional Cleaning Worth It?</h2>

            <h3>Cost Comparison</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professional clean (40sqm):</strong> £150-240</li>
                <li><strong>DIY hire + materials:</strong> £60-100 + 4-6 hours of your time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Professional Is Often Better Value</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Results last longer:</strong> 18-24 months vs 6-12 months for DIY</li>
                <li><strong>Better equipment:</strong> Hot water and higher pressure kill moss at the root</li>
                <li><strong>No risk of damage:</strong> Professionals know correct pressure for each surface</li>
                <li><strong>Re-sanding included:</strong> DIY often skips this critical step</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Any damage is covered</li>
                <li><strong>Your time:</strong> Spend your weekend doing something else</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When DIY Makes Sense</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Very small area (under 15sqm)</li>
                <li>Light dirt only, no moss</li>
                <li>You already own a decent pressure washer</li>
                <li>Tarmac or concrete (no re-sanding needed)</li>
            </ul>
