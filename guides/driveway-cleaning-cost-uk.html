            <p><strong>The quick answer:</strong> Professional driveway cleaning in the UK costs <strong>£3-6 per square metre</strong> in 2026. A typical single-car driveway (25sqm) costs <strong>£80-150</strong>. A double driveway (50sqm) costs <strong>£150-300</strong>. Prices include high-pressure cleaning and, for block paving, re-sanding of joints.</p>

            <p>This guide breaks down exactly what affects pricing, what's included, and how to get the best value for your money. Whether you're in Surrey, London, or elsewhere in the UK, understanding these costs will help you budget appropriately and avoid overpaying.</p>

            <h2>Driveway Cleaning Prices by Size</h2>

            <p>The size of your driveway is the primary factor determining cost. Larger driveways benefit from economies of scale, so the per-square-metre rate typically decreases as the area increases. Here's what you can expect to pay in 2026:</p>

            <h3>Small Driveway (15-25 sqm)</h3>
            <p>Typical: Single car space, terraced house</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic clean:</strong> £60-100</li>
                <li><strong>With re-sanding:</strong> £80-120</li>
                <li><strong>With sealing:</strong> £140-200</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Small driveways are common in terraced properties and older homes throughout Surrey towns like Redhill, Reigate, and Horley. Despite the smaller area, minimum call-out charges mean the per-square-metre rate is often higher than larger driveways.</p>

            <h3>Medium Driveway (25-45 sqm)</h3>
            <p>Typical: Two-car driveway, semi-detached house</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic clean:</strong> £100-180</li>
                <li><strong>With re-sanding:</strong> £120-200</li>
                <li><strong>With sealing:</strong> £200-350</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is the most common driveway size across suburban Surrey. Semi-detached houses in areas like Banstead, Epsom, and Dorking typically fall into this category. At this size, you start to see better value per square metre.</p>

            <h3>Large Driveway (45-70 sqm)</h3>
            <p>Typical: Three-car driveway, detached house</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic clean:</strong> £150-280</li>
                <li><strong>With re-sanding:</strong> £180-320</li>
                <li><strong>With sealing:</strong> £300-500</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Detached properties in affluent areas like Reigate Hill, Oxted, and Leatherhead often have driveways of this size. The larger area means better economies of scale and lower per-metre pricing.</p>

            <h3>Extra Large Driveway (70+ sqm)</h3>
            <p>Typical: Large detached, multiple vehicles, turning areas</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic clean:</strong> £250-450</li>
                <li><strong>With re-sanding:</strong> £300-500</li>
                <li><strong>With sealing:</strong> £450-700+</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Premium properties with extensive driveways, such as those found in the Surrey Hills or around Cobham and Esher, fall into this category. For very large properties, expect to negotiate package deals that include patios, paths, and other exterior surfaces.</p>

            <h2>Prices by Driveway Material</h2>

            <p>Different driveway materials require different cleaning approaches, equipment, and time. This affects the final price you'll pay. Here's a breakdown of costs by material type:</p>

            <h3>Block Paving</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £3.50-6 per sqm</p>
            <p>Block paving is the most common driveway type in the UK and costs slightly more because joints need re-sanding with kiln-dried sand after cleaning. The sand stabilises blocks, prevents weeds, and discourages ants. Without proper re-sanding, weeds will regrow within weeks and the blocks can become unstable.</p>
            <p>Block paving driveways are particularly popular in Surrey new-builds and housing developments. The cleaning process involves removing moss and debris from joints before washing, then applying fresh kiln-dried sand once the surface has dried.</p>

            <h3>Tarmac/Asphalt</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £2.50-4 per sqm</p>
            <p>Tarmac is generally the cheapest to clean - no joints mean no re-sanding required. However, very old tarmac needs lower pressure to avoid surface damage. Tarmac driveways are common in older properties throughout Redhill, Croydon, and Crawley.</p>
            <p>One consideration with tarmac is that it can become soft in very hot weather. Professional cleaners will schedule tarmac jobs appropriately and adjust their technique for older surfaces that may be more fragile.</p>

            <h3>Concrete</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £3-5 per sqm</p>
            <p>Concrete driveways clean well but may need pre-treatment for oil stains. Older concrete can be porous and may benefit from sealing after cleaning. Patterned or imprinted concrete requires extra care to avoid damaging the surface pattern and typically costs at the higher end of the range.</p>
            <p>Many properties in Surrey have decorative concrete driveways that mimic stone or brick. These require specialist knowledge to clean without damaging the surface texture or colour.</p>

            <h3>Natural Stone</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £4-7 per sqm</p>
            <p>Natural stone (sandstone, granite, slate) requires more care. Softer stones like sandstone need lower pressure and may take longer. Granite is more robust but still requires appropriate techniques to avoid surface damage.</p>
            <p>Indian sandstone is extremely popular for driveways and patios in Surrey. It's porous and prone to algae growth, requiring careful cleaning at lower pressures. Granite and slate are more forgiving but still benefit from professional equipment and expertise.</p>

            <h3>Resin Bound</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> £3-5 per sqm</p>
            <p>Resin driveways are relatively easy to clean and stay cleaner longer. No joints mean no re-sanding required. The smooth surface resists moss and weed growth better than block paving, making them increasingly popular for new installations.</p>
            <p>Resin-bound driveways have become increasingly common in Surrey over the past decade. They require gentle cleaning to avoid damaging the resin surface, but their low maintenance nature means they rarely need intensive treatment.</p>

            <h2>What's Included in the Price?</h2>

            <p>Understanding what's included in a driveway cleaning quote helps you compare prices fairly. Reputable companies will provide transparent pricing that covers all standard services.</p>

            <h3>Standard Cleaning Includes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-treatment:</strong> Application of moss/algae killer before pressure washing. This loosens biological growth and makes cleaning more effective.</li>
                <li><strong>High-pressure cleaning:</strong> Professional 3000+ PSI equipment with hot water for superior results.</li>
                <li><strong>Rotary surface cleaning:</strong> Industrial rotary cleaners for even, streak-free results. These spin at high speed to provide consistent coverage without the striping that can occur with lance-only cleaning.</li>
                <li><strong>Edge detailing:</strong> Hand cleaning of edges, corners, and around obstacles like drain covers, plant pots, and walls.</li>
                <li><strong>Re-sanding (block paving):</strong> Kiln-dried sand swept into all joints to stabilise blocks and prevent weed regrowth.</li>
                <li><strong>Debris removal:</strong> Cleaning up and removing any debris created during the process.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Usually Extra:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oil stain treatment:</strong> £10-30 per stain depending on size and age. Fresh oil is easier to remove than old, ingrained stains.</li>
                <li><strong>Sealing:</strong> £3-8 per sqm additional. Sealing protects block paving and enhances colour for 3-5 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed treatment:</strong> £15-40 if significant weed growth needs clearing before cleaning can begin.</li>
                <li><strong>Moss treatment:</strong> £20-50 for heavy moss removal requiring extensive pre-treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Efflorescence treatment:</strong> £30-60 for white salt staining on block paving, which requires specialist treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Gutter clearing:</strong> £30-60 if combined with driveway cleaning (often discounted as part of a package).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Factors That Affect Price</h2>

            <p>Several variables can push your quote higher or lower than the average prices listed above. Understanding these factors helps you anticipate costs and potentially take steps to reduce them.</p>

            <h3>1. Condition of the Driveway</h3>
            <p>A lightly soiled driveway that was cleaned last year takes less time than one with 5 years of moss buildup. Heavy soiling can add 20-30% to the price because it requires more pre-treatment, multiple passes, and additional time.</p>
            <p>If your driveway hasn't been cleaned in several years, expect to pay more for the initial restoration clean. Subsequent maintenance cleans will be considerably cheaper if done regularly.</p>

            <h3>2. Access</h3>
            <p>Easy access (equipment can park on or next to the driveway) keeps costs down. Difficult access - carrying equipment through the house, up slopes, or far from water supply - adds time and cost.</p>
            <p>Properties with steep driveways, those accessed via narrow lanes, or homes where water and electricity are not easily accessible may face surcharges of £20-50.</p>

            <h3>3. Location</h3>
            <p>Prices are higher in London and the South East (£4-7 per sqm) compared to the North (£2.50-4.50 per sqm). Surrey prices typically sit at £3-6 per sqm, reflecting the affluent nature of the county and higher operating costs.</p>
            <p>Within Surrey, you may find slightly lower prices in Crawley and Croydon compared to premium areas like Reigate Hill, Cobham, or Esher, though differences are usually modest.</p>

            <h3>4. Time of Year</h3>
            <p>Spring is peak season - prices may be slightly higher and availability limited as homeowners rush to clean up after winter. Summer remains busy, particularly in good weather. Winter is quieter but weather can delay jobs, and some companies reduce operations during the coldest months.</p>
            <p>Booking during autumn or late winter can sometimes secure better rates, though availability of good weather windows may be limited.</p>

            <h3>5. Additional Areas</h3>
            <p>Combining driveway cleaning with patio, paths, or walls often gets a better per-sqm rate than booking separately. Many customers save 10-20% by having all exterior surfaces cleaned in a single visit.</p>
            <p>If you have a patio, garden paths, or rendered walls that also need cleaning, ask for a combined quote. The setup time and travel costs are spread across a larger job, benefiting both parties.</p>

            <h3>6. Company Reputation and Insurance</h3>
            <p>Established companies with proper insurance, professional equipment, and good reviews typically charge more than individuals operating informally. However, the peace of mind from knowing you're protected if something goes wrong is often worth the premium.</p>
            <p>Always check that your chosen cleaner has public liability insurance - this protects you if they accidentally damage your property or injure themselves on your premises.</p>

            <h2>Regional Pricing: Surrey and the South East</h2>

            <p>Prices in Surrey and the surrounding areas tend to be at the higher end of the UK average due to the affluent nature of the county and higher business operating costs. Here's what you can typically expect:</p>

            <h3>Surrey Pricing Guide</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Redhill/Reigate area:</strong> £3.50-5.50 per sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Horley/Crawley area:</strong> £3-5 per sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Dorking/Leatherhead:</strong> £4-6 per sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Banstead/Epsom:</strong> £4-6 per sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Oxted/Caterham:</strong> £3.50-5.50 per sqm</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These prices reflect the local market conditions. Areas with higher property values and household incomes tend to support higher service prices, while more competitive markets like Crawley may offer slightly better rates.</p>

            <h2>How to Calculate Your Driveway Size</h2>

            <p>To estimate your cost, you need your driveway's size in square metres. Here's how to measure it accurately:</p>

            <h3>Simple Rectangle</h3>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Length (m) x Width (m) = Square metres</p>
            <p>Example: 8m long x 4m wide = 32 square metres</p>

            <h3>L-Shaped or Irregular</h3>
            <p>Break it into rectangles, calculate each, and add together. For example, an L-shaped driveway might be calculated as two separate rectangles: one 6m x 3m (18sqm) plus one 4m x 3m (12sqm) = 30sqm total.</p>

            <h3>Using Online Tools</h3>
            <p>You can also use Google Maps to measure your driveway. Right-click on the satellite view and select "Measure distance" to trace around your driveway's perimeter. This gives a reasonable estimate without going outside with a tape measure.</p>

            <h3>Common Sizes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single car space:</strong> 15-25 sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Double width:</strong> 35-50 sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Large family driveway:</strong> 50-80 sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Large with turning area:</strong> 80-120 sqm</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Is Professional Cleaning Worth It?</h2>

            <p>Many homeowners wonder whether they should hire a professional or tackle driveway cleaning themselves. Here's an honest comparison:</p>

            <h3>Cost Comparison</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professional clean (40sqm):</strong> £150-240</li>
                <li><strong>DIY hire + materials:</strong> £60-100 + 4-6 hours of your time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Professional Is Often Better Value</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Results last longer:</strong> 18-24 months vs 6-12 months for DIY due to professional equipment and techniques</li>
                <li><strong>Better equipment:</strong> Hot water and higher pressure kill moss at the root, preventing rapid regrowth</li>
                <li><strong>No risk of damage:</strong> Professionals know correct pressure for each surface and won't accidentally damage your driveway</li>
                <li><strong>Re-sanding included:</strong> DIY often skips this critical step, leading to weed problems within weeks</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Any damage is covered by the professional's public liability insurance</li>
                <li><strong>Your time:</strong> Spend your weekend doing something else - professionals work faster with better equipment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When DIY Makes Sense</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Very small area (under 15sqm) where professional minimum charges make it expensive</li>
                <li>Light dirt only, no moss or algae requiring pre-treatment</li>
                <li>You already own a decent pressure washer (2000+ PSI)</li>
                <li>Tarmac or concrete (no re-sanding needed)</li>
                <li>You enjoy outdoor DIY projects and have time available</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Get an Accurate Quote</h2>
