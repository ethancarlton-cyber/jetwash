            <p><strong>The quick answer:</strong> The best time to clean your patio in the UK is <strong>late spring (April-May)</strong> to prepare for summer, or <strong>early autumn (September-October)</strong> to clear summer dirt before winter. Avoid freezing weather and extended wet periods.</p>

            <p>Timing your patio clean correctly makes a real difference to the results and how long they last. This guide explains the pros and cons of each season, ideal weather conditions, and when to avoid cleaning altogether.</p>

            <h2>Spring Cleaning: April to May (Recommended)</h2>

            <p>Spring is the most popular time for patio cleaning, and for good reason:</p>

            <h3>Why Spring Works Well</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Winter growth is complete</strong> - Moss and algae grow most in winter's damp conditions. By April, the worst growth has happened and you can remove it all at once.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather is warming</strong> - Temperatures above 10°C allow proper drying and any treatments to work effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Ready for summer</strong> - Your patio will be clean and safe for BBQs, garden parties and outdoor dining.</li>
                <li><strong>Longer days</strong> - More daylight means more drying time before evening dew.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth is slower</strong> - A clean patio in spring will stay cleaner longer as algae growth slows in warmer, drier months.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Spring Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>April showers can delay cleaning - check the forecast for a dry spell of 2-3 days.</li>
                <li>Book early - spring is peak season for professional patio cleaning, and slots fill up fast.</li>
                <li>Pollen can settle on wet surfaces - not a major issue but worth knowing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Summer Cleaning: June to August</h2>

            <p>Summer cleaning is possible but has drawbacks:</p>

            <h3>Summer Pros</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fastest drying</strong> - Warm temperatures and longer days mean surfaces dry quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictable weather</strong> - Generally less rain than spring or autumn (though UK summers vary!).</li>
                <li><strong>Easier scheduling</strong> - Less demand means easier appointment booking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summer Cons</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You miss summer use</strong> - If you clean in July, you've already missed half the outdoor season.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat can cause streaking</strong> - Very hot surfaces dry too fast, leaving watermarks and cleaning solution residue.</li>
                <li><strong>BBQ season adds new dirt</strong> - Grease, food and drink spills will dirty your freshly cleaned patio.</li>
                <li><strong>Water restrictions</strong> - Hosepipe bans during droughts can affect pressure washing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Summer cleaning works if you've missed spring, but you'll get less value from the clean.</p>

            <h2>Autumn Cleaning: September to October (Recommended)</h2>

            <p>Autumn is an underrated time for patio cleaning:</p>

            <h3>Why Autumn Works Well</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Removes summer buildup</strong> - BBQ grease, sunscreen residue, food and drink spills from summer entertaining.</li>
                <li><strong>Prevents winter damage</strong> - Removing organic matter before winter stops it decomposing into the surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Moss prevention</strong> - A clean surface with fresh treatments resists winter moss growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Mild temperatures</strong> - September and October typically offer 10-15°C, ideal for cleaning and drying.</li>
                <li><strong>Less demand</strong> - Easier to book a professional cleaner than in spring.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Autumn Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't leave it too late - November brings shorter days, colder temperatures and frost risk.</li>
                <li>Falling leaves can dirty a freshly cleaned patio - consider timing around your trees.</li>
                <li>Check frost forecasts - avoid cleaning if frost is predicted within 48 hours.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Winter Cleaning: November to March (Not Recommended)</h2>

            <p>Winter cleaning is technically possible but problematic:</p>

            <h3>Why Winter Is Problematic</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frost damage</strong> - Water in cracks and pores can freeze, expanding and causing surface damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow drying</strong> - Short days and low temperatures mean surfaces stay wet for days.</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment ineffectiveness</strong> - Many moss killers and sealers won't work below 5°C.</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate re-soiling</strong> - Wet, muddy conditions mean the patio gets dirty again quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Working conditions</strong> - Cold, wet work is harder to do well.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If You Must Clean in Winter</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose a mild spell with temperatures above 5°C for several days.</li>
                <li>Check no frost is forecast for at least 48 hours after cleaning.</li>
                <li>Avoid cleaning before heavy rain is forecast.</li>
                <li>Accept that results may not last as long.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Ideal Weather Conditions for Patio Cleaning</h2>

            <p>Regardless of season, these are the ideal conditions:</p>

            <h3>Perfect Conditions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> 10-20°C - warm enough for drying, not so hot surfaces dry too fast.</li>
                <li><strong>Dry spell:</strong> No rain forecast for 24-48 hours after cleaning.</li>
                <li><strong>Overcast or light sun:</strong> Direct hot sun can cause streaking and premature drying.</li>
                <li><strong>Light breeze:</strong> Helps drying without blowing debris onto wet surfaces.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conditions to Avoid</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frost:</strong> Never clean if frost is forecast within 48 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Heavy rain:</strong> Dilutes treatments and you can't see your work.</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme heat (25°C+):</strong> Causes streaking and water marks.</li>
                <li><strong>High winds:</strong> Blows debris and spray everywhere.</li>
                <li><strong>Freezing temperatures:</strong> Water in cracks can freeze and cause damage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Surrey-Specific Advice</h2>

            <p>If you're in Surrey or the South East:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clay soil areas:</strong> Heavy clay soil in parts of Surrey means poor drainage and more moss. Consider autumn cleaning to prepare for wet winters.</li>
                <li><strong>North Downs:</strong> Properties near the chalk downs may have lighter coloured patios that show dirt more easily - spring cleaning helps.</li>
                <li><strong>Tree coverage:</strong> Surrey's wooded areas mean lots of leaf fall in autumn. Time your clean for after leaves have fallen or before they start.</li>
                <li><strong>Local climate:</strong> Surrey gets less rainfall than the west of England but more than the east. Average conditions suit spring or autumn cleaning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Often Should You Clean Your Patio?</h2>

            <p>Most patios benefit from professional cleaning every 12-18 months. If you clean in spring, your next clean would be the following spring. Some homeowners prefer twice-yearly cleaning (spring and autumn) for year-round appearance.</p>

            <p>Factors that increase cleaning frequency:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heavy shade from trees or buildings</li>
                <li>Porous surfaces like Indian sandstone</li>
                <li>White or light-coloured paving</li>
                <li>Regular BBQ and outdoor dining use</li>
                <li>Overhanging trees dropping leaves and sap</li>
            </ul>
