            <p><strong>The quick answer:</strong> For fresh oil stains, absorb with cat litter immediately, then scrub with washing up liquid and hot water. For old stains, you'll need commercial degreasers or professional treatment. The sooner you act, the better your chances of complete removal.</p>

            <p>Oil stains are one of the most common and frustrating driveway problems. This guide covers exactly how to tackle them, from emergency spills to years-old marks.</p>

            <h2>Why Oil Stains Are So Difficult to Remove</h2>

            <p>Understanding why oil stains are problematic helps you treat them effectively:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oil penetrates porous surfaces:</strong> Block paving, concrete and natural stone all have tiny pores. Oil seeps into these, going deeper the longer it sits.</li>
                <li><strong>Oil repels water:</strong> This is why pressure washing alone doesn't work - the water just beads off.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat makes it worse:</strong> Summer sun warms the oil, making it more liquid and helping it penetrate deeper.</li>
                <li><strong>Age matters:</strong> Fresh oil sits on the surface. After 24-48 hours, it starts penetrating. After weeks or months, it's deep in the material.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Removing Fresh Oil Stains (Within 24 Hours)</h2>

            <p>If you catch the spill quickly, you have a good chance of complete removal. Here's what to do:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Absorb the Oil Immediately</h3>
            <p>Cover the entire stain generously with an absorbent material:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best:</strong> Cat litter (clay type, not silica)</li>
                <li><strong>Also works:</strong> Sawdust, sand, cornflour, baking soda</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Leave for 30 minutes to several hours. The longer the better. Sweep up and dispose of in general waste (not compost).</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Apply Washing Up Liquid</h3>
            <p>Squirt a generous amount of washing up liquid (Fairy or similar) directly onto the stain. The surfactants in washing up liquid break down oil.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Scrub with Hot Water</h3>
            <p>Pour hot (not boiling) water over the stain and scrub vigorously with a stiff brush. Work the washing up liquid into the stain.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Rinse and Repeat</h3>
            <p>Rinse with clean water. If staining remains, repeat steps 2-4. Multiple applications are often needed.</p>

            <h3>Alternative: Coca-Cola Method</h3>
            <p>Some people swear by pouring Coca-Cola (not diet) on oil stains. The phosphoric acid helps break down oil. Pour on, leave overnight, scrub and rinse in the morning. It works, but no better than proper degreaser.</p>

            <h2>Removing Old Oil Stains (More Than 24 Hours)</h2>

            <p>Older stains have penetrated the surface and need stronger treatment:</p>

            <h3>Method 1: Commercial Degreaser</h3>
            <p><strong>Products to try:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Oil Vanish (widely available, effective)</li>
                <li>Everbuild Oil Stain Remover</li>
                <li>Thompsons Oil and Drive Stain Remover</li>
                <li>Brick acid (for concrete only - test first)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Apply degreaser generously to the stain</li>
                <li>Leave for 15-30 minutes (follow product instructions)</li>
                <li>Scrub with stiff brush</li>
                <li>Rinse with pressure washer or strong hose</li>
                <li>Repeat 2-3 times for stubborn stains</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Method 2: Poultice Treatment</h3>
            <p>A poultice draws oil out of the surface over time. This is the best method for deep, old stains.</p>

            <p><strong>DIY Poultice:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix cat litter or diatomaceous earth with acetone or white spirit to make a paste</li>
                <li>Spread 1cm thick over the stain</li>
                <li>Cover with plastic sheeting to slow evaporation</li>
                <li>Leave for 24-48 hours</li>
                <li>Scrape off and dispose</li>
                <li>Repeat if necessary</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Commercial poultice products</strong> like Oil Out are easier to use and often more effective.</p>

            <h3>Method 3: Biological Treatment</h3>
            <p>Specialist bio-remediation products use bacteria to "eat" the oil. Products like Bio-Remediation Oil Stain Remover work over several weeks but can remove very old stains that nothing else touches.</p>

            <h2>Professional Oil Stain Removal</h2>

            <p>When DIY methods fail, or for valuable surfaces, professional treatment is the answer.</p>

            <h3>What Professionals Do Differently</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hot water pressure washing:</strong> Water heated to 150°C breaks down oil far more effectively than cold water</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial degreasers:</strong> Stronger than retail products</li>
                <li><strong>Higher pressure:</strong> 3000+ PSI lifts oil from deeper in the surface</li>
                <li><strong>Steam cleaning:</strong> For delicate surfaces where high pressure isn't suitable</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple treatments:</strong> We can return for stubborn stains</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Professional Treatment Costs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Small stain (up to 30cm):</strong> £10-20</li>
                <li><strong>Medium stain (30-60cm):</strong> £20-30</li>
                <li><strong>Large stain (60cm+):</strong> £30-50</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple stains:</strong> Often discounted when done with full driveway clean</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Professional treatment is usually done alongside a full driveway clean for best results.</p>

            <h2>Oil Stain Removal by Surface Type</h2>

            <h3>Block Paving</h3>
            <p>Block paving is moderately porous. Fresh stains remove well. Old stains may leave slight shadowing. Don't use brick acid - it can damage the surface. Standard degreasers are safe.</p>

            <h3>Concrete</h3>
            <p>Concrete is very porous and absorbs oil quickly. Act fast on fresh spills. Old stains often leave shadows. Brick acid can help on concrete but test first - it can etch the surface.</p>

            <h3>Tarmac/Asphalt</h3>
            <p>Tarmac is an oil-based product, so ironically it's the hardest to clean. Solvents that dissolve oil can also soften tarmac. Stick to degreasers only - no brick acid or strong solvents.</p>

            <h3>Natural Stone</h3>
            <p>Natural stone varies widely. Sandstone is very porous and stains easily. Granite is dense and resists staining. Use only pH-neutral cleaners on natural stone - acids can etch and damage. Professional treatment recommended for valuable stone.</p>

            <h2>Preventing Oil Stains</h2>

            <p>Prevention is easier than removal:</p>

            <h3>Regular Vehicle Maintenance</h3>
            <p>The best prevention is a vehicle that doesn't leak. If your car leaks oil, get it fixed. A £50 gasket replacement is cheaper than repeated driveway cleaning.</p>

            <h3>Use a Drip Tray</h3>
            <p>If your car occasionally drips (older vehicles often do), place a drip tray or old towel under the engine when parked.</p>

            <h3>Cardboard Under Parked Vehicles</h3>
            <p>Flattened cardboard boxes under the engine catch drips. Replace when saturated.</p>

            <h3>Seal Your Driveway</h3>
            <p>Sealed block paving resists oil penetration. Oil sits on the sealed surface and can be wiped away before it penetrates. Sealing costs £3-8 per sqm but pays for itself in easier maintenance.</p>

            <h3>Act Immediately</h3>
            <p>Keep cat litter in the garage. The moment you see a drip or spill, cover it. Five minutes of action saves hours of scrubbing later.</p>

            <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>

            <p>Save yourself time and money by avoiding these ineffective methods:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>WD-40:</strong> It's an oil-based product. It won't remove oil stains and may make them worse.</li>
                <li><strong>Bleach:</strong> Doesn't break down oil. May discolour your driveway.</li>
                <li><strong>Cold water pressure washing alone:</strong> Oil repels water. You'll just spread it around.</li>
                <li><strong>Petrol/gasoline:</strong> Dangerous, doesn't work well, and can damage surfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Paint thinners on tarmac:</strong> Will dissolve the tarmac along with the oil.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to Accept the Stain</h2>

            <p>Sometimes, complete removal isn't possible:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Very old stains (years) on porous surfaces often leave some shadowing</li>
                <li>Repeated treatments can damage some surfaces more than the stain does</li>
                <li>If the stain is under where you park anyway, it's barely visible</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A professional can give you an honest assessment of what's achievable.</p>
