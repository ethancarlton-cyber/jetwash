            <p><strong>The honest answer:</strong> DIY pressure washing works for light maintenance on small areas. For heavily soiled driveways, block paving needing re-sanding, or delicate surfaces, professional cleaning delivers significantly better results that last 2-3 times longer.</p>

            <p>We're a professional pressure washing company, so you might expect us to say "always hire a professional." But we believe in honest advice - sometimes DIY genuinely makes sense. This guide helps you decide which is right for your situation.</p>

            <h2>Cost Comparison: DIY vs Professional</h2>

            <p>Let's break down the real costs for a typical 40 square metre driveway:</p>

            <h3>DIY Costs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pressure washer hire:</strong> £40-80 per day (decent 2000+ PSI machine)</li>
                <li><strong>Cleaning chemicals:</strong> £10-20</li>
                <li><strong>Kiln-dried sand (block paving):</strong> £15-30</li>
                <li><strong>Your time:</strong> 4-6 hours for 40sqm</li>
                <li><strong>Total cash cost:</strong> £65-130</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Professional Costs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professional cleaning:</strong> £120-240 (£3-6 per sqm)</li>
                <li><strong>Includes:</strong> All equipment, chemicals, re-sanding, moss treatment</li>
                <li><strong>Your time:</strong> 0 hours (you can be elsewhere)</li>
                <li><strong>Total cash cost:</strong> £120-240</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Real Calculation</h3>
            <p>DIY saves £55-110 in cash costs. But you're spending 4-6 hours of your weekend. If you value your time at £15/hour, DIY actually costs roughly the same. If you earn more than that, or simply prefer spending weekends doing something else, professional cleaning is the better deal.</p>

            <h2>Equipment Differences</h2>

            <p>This is where the results gap comes from:</p>

            <h3>Domestic Pressure Washers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> 1500-2000 PSI (adequate for light dirt)</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Cold only</li>
                <li><strong>Flow rate:</strong> 5-8 litres per minute</li>
                <li><strong>Attachments:</strong> Basic lance, maybe a patio cleaner</li>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> £100-400 to buy, £40-80/day to hire</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Professional Equipment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> 3000-4000 PSI (removes deep-set dirt)</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Hot water up to 150°C (kills moss/algae at the root)</li>
                <li><strong>Flow rate:</strong> 15-25 litres per minute</li>
                <li><strong>Attachments:</strong> Industrial rotary surface cleaners, turbo nozzles</li>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> £5,000-15,000 per machine</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>Higher pressure and flow rate means dirt is physically removed from deeper in the surface. Hot water kills moss and algae roots - cold water only removes the visible growth, leaving roots to regrow within months. Rotary surface cleaners give even, streak-free results that a hand-held lance can't match.</p>

            <h2>When DIY Makes Sense</h2>

            <p>DIY pressure washing is a reasonable choice when:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Light surface dirt only</strong> - No moss, just dust and light grime</li>
                <li><strong>Small area</strong> - Less than 20 square metres</li>
                <li><strong>Hard surfaces</strong> - Concrete, tarmac, or robust natural stone like granite</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance clean</strong> - Your driveway was professionally cleaned within the last year</li>
                <li><strong>You enjoy it</strong> - Some people genuinely find pressure washing satisfying</li>
                <li><strong>You have time</strong> - A spare 4-6 hours on a dry weekend</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to Hire a Professional</h2>

            <p>Professional cleaning is the better choice when:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heavy moss or algae growth</strong> - Established growth needs hot water to kill roots</li>
                <li><strong>Block paving</strong> - Needs re-sanding with kiln-dried sand after cleaning</li>
                <li><strong>Delicate surfaces</strong> - Indian sandstone, old concrete, render, or softwood decking</li>
                <li><strong>Large areas</strong> - 40+ square metres becomes a full day's work with domestic equipment</li>
                <li><strong>Years of buildup</strong> - If it hasn't been cleaned for 3+ years, domestic machines won't cut it</li>
                <li><strong>You want lasting results</strong> - Professional cleans last 18-24 months vs 6-12 for DIY</li>
                <li><strong>Oil or rust stains</strong> - Need specialist chemicals and techniques</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Risks of DIY Pressure Washing</h2>

            <p>We see the results of DIY cleaning gone wrong. Common problems include:</p>

            <h3>Surface Damage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Etching:</strong> Too-high pressure on concrete creates permanent pitting</li>
                <li><strong>Sand removal:</strong> Blasting sand out of block paving joints, leading to unstable blocks</li>
                <li><strong>Stone damage:</strong> Soft stones like sandstone can be permanently marked</li>
                <li><strong>Paint removal:</strong> Pressure washing strips paint from render and walls</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Poor Results</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zebra stripes:</strong> Uneven overlapping passes leave visible stripes</li>
                <li><strong>Missed areas:</strong> Without rotary cleaners, corners and edges are hard to reach</li>
                <li><strong>Quick regrowth:</strong> Cold water doesn't kill moss roots - it returns within months</li>
                <li><strong>White haze:</strong> Incorrect technique on block paving brings salts to the surface</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Personal Safety</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Injury:</strong> Pressure washers can cut through skin - serious injuries happen every year</li>
                <li><strong>Eye damage:</strong> Flying debris is a real risk without proper eye protection</li>
                <li><strong>Electrical hazard:</strong> Electric pressure washers and water are a dangerous combination</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Professionals Do Differently</h2>

            <p>Beyond better equipment, here's what professional cleaning involves:</p>

            <h3>Pre-Treatment</h3>
            <p>We assess the surface and apply appropriate pre-treatment chemicals. Different surfaces need different approaches - what works on concrete can damage sandstone.</p>

            <h3>Correct Pressure Selection</h3>
            <p>We adjust pressure for each surface. Block paving might get 2500 PSI while delicate Indian sandstone gets 1500 PSI with a wider spray pattern. One-size-fits-all damages surfaces.</p>

            <h3>Technique</h3>
            <p>Maintaining consistent distance, overlapping correctly, working with the slope for drainage, avoiding water ingress to buildings - there's more to it than pointing and spraying.</p>

            <h3>Re-Sanding (Block Paving)</h3>
            <p>We sweep kiln-dried sand into the joints after cleaning. This stabilises blocks, inhibits weed growth, and prevents ant infestations. Skipping this step means your block paving degrades faster.</p>

            <h3>Post-Treatment</h3>
            <p>Optional moss and algae inhibitors slow regrowth, extending time between cleans. Some customers also opt for sealing, which protects for 3-5 years.</p>

            <h2>The Results Comparison</h2>

            <h3>DIY Results</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Surface dirt removed</li>
                <li>Visible moss removed (roots remain)</li>
                <li>Possible streaking and uneven finish</li>
                <li>Results last 6-12 months typically</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Professional Results</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Deep-set dirt removed</li>
                <li>Moss and algae killed at the root</li>
                <li>Even, streak-free finish</li>
                <li>Re-sanded joints (block paving)</li>
                <li>Results last 18-24 months typically</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>

            <p>If you have a small, lightly soiled area of robust material (concrete or tarmac) and you don't mind spending a few hours on it - DIY can work.</p>

            <p>For everything else - block paving, natural stone, heavy moss, large areas, or if you simply value your weekends - professional cleaning delivers significantly better results that last twice as long. The price difference is minimal when you factor in your time.</p>
