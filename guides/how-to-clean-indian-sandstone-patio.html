            <p><strong>The quick answer:</strong> Indian sandstone requires gentle cleaning with pH-neutral products. Never use acid-based cleaners, bleach, or high-pressure settings. For best results without risk, professional cleaning with appropriate equipment and chemicals is recommended, especially in damp Surrey conditions where algae thrives.</p>

            <p>Indian sandstone is one of the most popular patio materials in the UK, prized for its natural beauty, warm colours, and durability. However, it's also one of the most commonly damaged stones due to incorrect cleaning methods. This guide will help you clean your sandstone patio safely and effectively.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Indian Sandstone</h2>

            <p>Before cleaning, it's important to understand what makes Indian sandstone special - and vulnerable:</p>

            <h3>What Makes Sandstone Different</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Porous structure:</strong> Sandstone absorbs liquids, meaning chemicals penetrate deep into the stone</li>
                <li><strong>Iron content:</strong> Many Indian sandstones contain iron, which reacts badly with acids causing orange staining</li>
                <li><strong>Softer than granite:</strong> Sandstone is relatively soft and can be etched by aggressive cleaning</li>
                <li><strong>Natural variation:</strong> Different slabs may have different mineral compositions and react differently</li>
                <li><strong>Riven surface:</strong> The natural textured surface traps dirt but is also easily damaged</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common Sandstone Types in Surrey Gardens</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Raj Green:</strong> Green/grey tones, moderate iron content</li>
                <li><strong>Autumn Brown:</strong> Brown/orange tones, higher iron content (more acid-sensitive)</li>
                <li><strong>Kandla Grey:</strong> Grey tones, generally more stable</li>
                <li><strong>Mint:</strong> Cream/mint tones, lighter colours show staining more</li>
                <li><strong>Modak:</strong> Pink/brown tones, can be quite porous</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Indian Sandstone Needs Special Care</h2>

            <p>The damp Surrey climate creates perfect conditions for biological growth on patios. Here's why sandstone needs different treatment to concrete or block paving:</p>

            <h3>Problems Unique to Sandstone</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acid sensitivity:</strong> Acids cause permanent discolouration and surface damage</li>
                <li><strong>Pressure sensitivity:</strong> High pressure etches the natural surface texture</li>
                <li><strong>Absorption:</strong> Chemicals soak in deeply and are hard to rinse out</li>
                <li><strong>Algae penetration:</strong> Algae roots grow into porous surfaces, not just on top</li>
                <li><strong>Efflorescence:</strong> White salt deposits can appear after cleaning if not done correctly</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In areas like Reigate, Redhill, and across Surrey, the combination of tree cover, rainfall, and mild winters means algae and moss growth is particularly aggressive. What works in drier climates often fails here.</p>

            <h2>DIY Cleaning Methods</h2>

            <p>If you want to clean Indian sandstone yourself, here are safe approaches ranked from gentlest to most aggressive:</p>

            <h3>Method 1: Soapy Water (Safest)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Light dirt, dust, and minor soiling</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mix warm water with a few drops of pH-neutral dish soap</li>
                <li>Sweep the patio thoroughly first</li>
                <li>Apply soapy water and scrub with a stiff brush</li>
                <li>Rinse thoroughly with clean water</li>
                <li>Allow to dry naturally</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Good for maintenance cleaning, won't remove established algae or moss</p>

            <h3>Method 2: Specialist Stone Cleaner (Recommended)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Moderate dirt, light algae growth</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Purchase a pH-neutral cleaner specifically designed for natural stone</li>
                <li>Follow manufacturer's dilution instructions exactly</li>
                <li>Apply to dry patio (wet stone dilutes the cleaner)</li>
                <li>Allow dwell time as specified (usually 15-30 minutes)</li>
                <li>Agitate with stiff brush</li>
                <li>Rinse thoroughly multiple times</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Recommended products:</strong> LTP Grimex, Lithofin MN Easy Clean, Everbuild 404 Fungicidal Wash</p>
            <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Around £15-30 for enough to treat 20-40sqm</p>

            <h3>Method 3: Low-Pressure Washing (With Caution)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Moderate to heavy soiling, established algae</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use maximum 1500 PSI (many domestic machines are 1800-2000 - these are too powerful)</li>
                <li>Use a wide fan nozzle (40-degree or wider) - never a turbo nozzle</li>
                <li>Keep the lance at least 30cm from the surface</li>
                <li>Work in sweeping motions, not concentrated spots</li>
                <li>Pre-treat with stone cleaner for better results</li>
                <li>Test in an inconspicuous area first</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Risks:</strong> Even at lower pressure, incorrect technique can etch the surface, expose softer layers, or force water into joints causing sand loss</p>

            <h2>Products to Avoid on Indian Sandstone</h2>

            <p>This is critical - using the wrong products causes permanent damage:</p>

            <h3>Never Use These Products</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patio acid / brick acid:</strong> Causes orange/yellow staining that's impossible to remove</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrochloric acid:</strong> Same as above - permanent damage</li>
                <li><strong>Bleach:</strong> Causes white patches and can weaken the stone surface</li>
                <li><strong>Vinegar:</strong> Acidic enough to cause etching over time</li>
                <li><strong>Lemon juice:</strong> Same acid problems as vinegar</li>
                <li><strong>General household cleaners:</strong> Often contain acids or alkalis that damage stone</li>
                <li><strong>Jeyes Fluid (undiluted):</strong> Too harsh, can cause discolouration</li>
                <li><strong>Sodium hypochlorite (neat):</strong> Bleaches colour and damages surface</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Warning Signs of Acid Damage</h3>
            <p>If you see these after cleaning, acid damage has occurred:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Orange or yellow patches appearing</li>
                <li>Surface feels rougher than before</li>
                <li>Colour has changed unevenly</li>
                <li>White or grey dull patches</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unfortunately, acid damage to sandstone is usually permanent. Some specialist restoration products can reduce visibility, but prevention is far better than cure.</p>

            <h2>Professional Cleaning Benefits</h2>

            <p>For Indian sandstone specifically, professional cleaning offers significant advantages:</p>

            <h3>Why Professionals Get Better Results</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Correct pressure:</strong> We use surface cleaners that apply even, controlled pressure - no lance marks or etching</li>
                <li><strong>Hot water:</strong> 150°C water kills algae at the root without aggressive chemicals - cold water only removes surface growth</li>
                <li><strong>Stone-specific chemicals:</strong> We use professional-grade pH-neutral cleaners formulated for natural stone</li>
                <li><strong>Experience with variations:</strong> We know how different sandstone types react and adjust our approach accordingly</li>
                <li><strong>Post-treatment:</strong> Algae inhibitors slow regrowth, extending time between cleans</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Professional Cleaning Includes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Assessment of stone type and condition</li>
                <li>Pre-treatment with appropriate stone cleaner</li>
                <li>Low-pressure hot water cleaning with rotary surface cleaner</li>
                <li>Joint cleaning and re-sanding if needed</li>
                <li>Post-treatment with algae inhibitor (optional)</li>
                <li>Sealing service available</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Sealing Indian Sandstone</h2>

            <p>Sealing is optional but offers real benefits for sandstone patios:</p>

            <h3>Benefits of Sealing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stain resistance:</strong> Oil, grease, wine, and leaves don't penetrate as easily</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced algae growth:</strong> Sealed surfaces don't hold moisture as readily</li>
                <li><strong>Colour enhancement:</strong> Enhancing sealers bring out natural colours</li>
                <li><strong>Easier cleaning:</strong> Dirt sits on the surface rather than soaking in</li>
                <li><strong>Protection from weathering:</strong> Reduces freeze-thaw damage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Sealer for Sandstone</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impregnating sealer (recommended):</strong> Soaks into the stone, invisible finish, allows stone to breathe. Brands like LTP Mattstone, Lithofin MN Stain-Stop</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing sealer:</strong> Darkens colour slightly, brings out natural tones. Use if you want a "wet look" without gloss</li>
                <li><strong>Topical sealer (not recommended):</strong> Sits on top of stone, can peel, traps moisture, causes problems</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When to Seal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>After professional cleaning, once completely dry (48+ hours of dry weather)</li>
                <li>New patios: Wait 8-12 weeks for natural salts to leach out first</li>
                <li>Reapply every 3-5 years depending on wear</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Maintenance Tips</h2>

            <p>Regular maintenance reduces the need for intensive cleaning:</p>

            <h3>Weekly/Monthly Tasks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sweep regularly:</strong> Removes organic debris that causes staining</li>
                <li><strong>Clear leaves promptly:</strong> Wet leaves stain sandstone - don't let them sit</li>
                <li><strong>Address spills immediately:</strong> Blot (don't wipe) spills with kitchen paper</li>
                <li><strong>Check drainage:</strong> Standing water promotes algae growth</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Seasonal Maintenance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Clear winter debris, wash with soapy water</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Good time for professional clean if needed (dries properly)</li>
                <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Keep on top of falling leaves</li>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Avoid salt/grit near the patio (causes damage)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Preventing Algae in Surrey</h3>
            <p>Our damp climate means algae is a constant battle. Reduce growth by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trimming overhanging vegetation to increase sunlight</li>
                <li>Improving drainage so water doesn't pool</li>
                <li>Using algae inhibitor treatments</li>
                <li>Considering sealing for added protection</li>
                <li>Scheduling professional cleans before growth becomes severe</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cost Comparison: DIY vs Professional</h2>

            <p>For a typical 30sqm Indian sandstone patio:</p>

            <h3>DIY Cleaning Costs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stone cleaner:</strong> £15-30</li>
                <li><strong>Stiff brush:</strong> £10-15</li>
                <li><strong>Your time:</strong> 4-6 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Total:</strong> £25-45 + your time</li>
                <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Potential for damage if wrong products used</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Professional Cleaning Costs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professional clean:</strong> £150-240 (£5-8 per sqm)</li>
                <li><strong>Sealing (optional):</strong> £90-150 (£3-5 per sqm)</li>
                <li><strong>Your time:</strong> 0 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Total:</strong> £150-390</li>
                <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Better results, no damage risk, lasts longer</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Long-Term Value</h3>
            <p>Professional cleaning typically lasts 18-24 months vs 6-12 months for DIY. Over 5 years:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DIY (5-6 cleans):</strong> £125-270 + 20-30 hours of your time</li>
                <li><strong>Professional (2-3 cleans):</strong> £300-720 + 0 hours of your time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Factor in your time and the risk of DIY damage, and professional cleaning often works out better value for sandstone specifically.</p>

            <h2>When to Call Professionals</h2>

            <p>Consider professional cleaning for Indian sandstone when:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heavy algae or moss:</strong> Established growth needs hot water treatment to kill roots</li>
                <li><strong>Staining:</strong> Oil, rust, or organic stains need specialist treatment</li>
