## Step 1: Google Search Console (REQUIRED - Day 1)

### What You Need:
- A Google account (Gmail) - **This is your ONLY required account**
- Your live website URL: `https://jetwash-psi.vercel.app`

### How to Do It:

**1. Go to Google Search Console:**
- Visit: https://search.google.com/search-console
- Sign in with your Google account

**2. Add Your Property:**
- Click "Add Property"
- Select **"URL prefix"** (NOT "Domain")
- Enter: `https://jetwash-psi.vercel.app`
- Click "Continue"

**3. Verify Ownership (HTML File Method):**
- Google will show you a verification file to download
- It looks like: `google1234567890abcdef.html`
- Download this file
- Place it in your `jetWash` folder (root directory)
- Push to GitHub:
  ```bash
  cd C:\Users\devel\Desktop\jetWash
  git add google*.html
  git commit -m "Add Google Search Console verification file"
  git push origin main
  ```
- Wait 30 seconds for Vercel to deploy
- Go back to Search Console and click "Verify"
- You should see: ✅ "Ownership verified"

**4. Submit Your Sitemap:**
- In Search Console, click "Sitemaps" (left menu)
- In the "Add a new sitemap" box, enter: `sitemap.xml`
- Click "Submit"
- Status should change to "Success"

**5. Request Indexing for Key Pages:**
- Click "URL Inspection" (top search bar)
- Enter these URLs one at a time:
  - `https://jetwash-psi.vercel.app/`
  - `https://jetwash-psi.vercel.app/quote.html`
  - `https://jetwash-psi.vercel.app/driveway-cleaning.html`
  - `https://jetwash-psi.vercel.app/patio-cleaning.html`
  - `https://jetwash-psi.vercel.app/areas/haywards-heath.html`
- For each URL, click "Request Indexing"
- Google will say: "Indexing requested"

**Done!** Google now knows your site exists and will start crawling it.

## Why Rankings Take 60-90 Days

**Google needs to:**
1. Crawl your site (discover all pages) - 1-2 weeks
2. Index your pages (add to search database) - 2-4 weeks
3. Evaluate your content quality - 4-8 weeks
4. Test your rankings vs competitors - 8-12 weeks
5. Gradually move you up if content is good - 12-16 weeks

**This is normal!** Even with perfect SEO, it takes 2-3 months.

---

## How to Speed Up Rankings (Still Free)

### 1. Get More Backlinks
- Add 2-3 new directory listings each month
- Local Facebook groups (post about your service)
- Nextdoor.com (local community - free)

### 2. Update Your Content
- Add more specific content to pages
- Answer common questions in FAQ
- Add more location pages (expand to nearby towns)

### 3. Keep Site Active
- Add a blog post every month (optional)
- Update pricing page if needed

### 4. Get Local Signals
- When you get leads, note which postcodes
- Add those specific areas to your location pages
- "We recently cleaned driveways in RH16 area"

---

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Pay for These (Yet):
- SEO tools (Ahrefs, SEMrush) - expensive, not needed at start
- Backlink services - often spammy, can hurt rankings
- Keyword research tools - you already have good keywords
- Google Ads - wait until organic proves the concept
- SEO agencies - £500-2,000/month, not worth it yet

### ❌ Don't Spam:
- Don't submit to 100 directories - quality over quantity
- Don't copy content from other sites - Google penalizes this
- Don't buy backlinks - Google will ban your site
- Don't keyword stuff - makes content unreadable

### ❌ Don't Give Up Early:
- SEO takes 60-90 days minimum
- First month = zero results (normal!)
- Month 2-3 = first signs of life
- Month 4-6 = real traffic starts

## How to Check If It's Working

### Every Week, Check:
1. **Google Search Console → Coverage**
   - Are all 17 pages indexed?
   - Any errors?

2. **Google Search Console → Performance**
   - Total impressions (how many people see your site in search)
   - Total clicks (how many people click)
   - Which keywords show your site

3. **Manual Search**
   - Search "site:jetwash-psi.vercel.app" in Google
   - Shows all your indexed pages

### Good Signs (Week 4-8):
- ✅ All pages indexed (17/17)
- ✅ Impressions increasing (5 → 20 → 50 → 100+)
- ✅ Appearing in search for ANY keywords (even position 100)
- ✅ Click-through rate above 0% (someone clicked!)

### Red Flags:
- ❌ No pages indexed after 4 weeks → resubmit sitemap
- ❌ Pages indexed then disappeared → check for errors
- ❌ Zero impressions after 8 weeks → check backlinks
