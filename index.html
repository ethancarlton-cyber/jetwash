More frequent cleaning may be needed for high-traffic commercial properties or driveways with oil stain issues."

A small single driveway typically takes 2-3 hours, while a large double driveway may take 4-6 hours. Heavily soiled driveways with significant oil staining or moss growth may require additional time for pre-treatment and thorough cleaning. We work efficiently without compromising quality, and your driveway is ready to use immediately after cleaning, though we recommend avoiding parking for 24 hours if sealing is applied."

We use specialist pre-treatment solutions that break down oil and grease, followed by high-pressure washing to lift stains from the surface. Very old or deeply penetrated oil stains may lighten significantly but not disappear completely on porous surfaces like block paving. The effectiveness depends on how long the stain has been present, the surface type, and the depth of oil penetration into the material."

While we can eliminate existing black spots, they may gradually return over 1-2 years depending on environmental conditions.
