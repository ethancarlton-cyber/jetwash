For a one-off deep clean, professional service often provides better value."

            <h2>How Often Should You Clean Your Driveway?</h2>

            <p>In Surrey's damp climate, most driveways benefit from professional cleaning every <strong>12-18 months</strong>. However, this varies depending on several factors:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shaded driveways</strong> - Clean annually. Less sunlight means faster moss and algae growth</li>
                <li><strong>Under trees</strong> - Clean annually. Fallen leaves, sap, and bird droppings accelerate dirt buildup</li>
                <li><strong>South-facing, open driveways</strong> - Every 18-24 months may suffice</li>
                <li><strong>Block paving</strong> - Every 12-18 months, with re-sanding as needed</li>
                <li><strong>High traffic areas</strong> - More frequent cleaning if you have multiple vehicles</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Best Time of Year for Pressure Washing</h2>

            <h3>Spring (March - May) - Recommended</h3>
            <p>Spring is ideal for pressure washing. You're removing winter's accumulated grime, road salt residue, and preparing your driveway for summer. The weather is warming up but not too hot, and surfaces dry quickly.</p>

            <h3>Autumn (September - November) - Also Good</h3>
            <p>Autumn cleaning removes fallen leaves, organic matter, and summer's dust before winter. It's a good preventative measure - less organic material means less moss growth over winter.</p>

            <h3>Avoid: Winter (December - February)</h3>
            <p>Pressure washing in freezing temperatures is risky. Water can freeze in block paving joints and cracks, causing expansion damage. Wait for temperatures consistently above 5°C.</p>

            <h3>Summer (June - August) - Possible</h3>
            <p>Summer works but isn't ideal. Hot weather can cause cleaning solutions to dry too quickly, and you'll be using your outdoor space when it's being cleaned.</p>

            <h2>DIY vs Professional Pressure Washing</h2>

            <h3>When DIY Makes Sense:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Small areas (single patio, small path)</li>
                <li>Regular light maintenance between professional cleans</li>
                <li>You own a quality pressure washer and know how to use it</li>
                <li>The surface is robust (concrete, not delicate stone)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When to Call Professionals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Large driveways</strong> - Professional equipment is 5-10x more powerful and faster</li>
                <li><strong>Block paving</strong> - Incorrect pressure dislodges jointing sand, causing weed problems</li>
                <li><strong>Natural stone</strong> - Different stones need different pressures and techniques</li>
                <li><strong>Heavy moss/algae</strong> - May need pre-treatment and biocide application</li>
                <li><strong>Render or painted surfaces</strong> - Requires soft washing, not pressure washing</li>
                <li><strong>You want it done properly, once</strong> - Professional results last longer</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Surrey Driveways Go Green So Fast</h2>

            <p>Surrey's climate creates perfect conditions for organic growth:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>High rainfall</strong> - Moisture promotes algae and moss</li>
                <li><strong>Mild temperatures</strong> - Rarely cold enough to kill spores</li>
                <li><strong>Clay soil</strong> - Common in Surrey, retains moisture around surfaces</li>
                <li><strong>Tree coverage</strong> - Many Surrey properties have mature trees creating shade</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Slow Down Green Growth:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Professional cleaning with biocide</strong> - Kills spores, not just removes visible growth</li>
                <li><strong>Improve drainage</strong> - Standing water accelerates growth</li>
                <li><strong>Trim overhanging vegetation</strong> - More sunlight = slower growth</li>
                <li><strong>Regular sweeping</strong> - Remove leaves and organic debris promptly</li>
                <li><strong>Consider sealing</strong> - Block paving sealers reduce moisture absorption</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Common Driveway Cleaning Mistakes</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pressure too high</strong> - Damages surfaces, especially block paving and soft stone</li>
                <li><strong>Holding nozzle too close</strong> - Creates stripes and uneven cleaning</li>
                <li><strong>Not pre-treating</strong> - Heavy moss needs treatment before pressure washing</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring joints</strong> - Block paving needs re-sanding after cleaning</li>
                <li><strong>Wrong chemicals</strong> - Bleach damages plants and some surface types</li>
                <li><strong>Cleaning in circles</strong> - Creates visible swirl marks. Use consistent patterns</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Block Paving Care Tips</h2>

            <p>Block paving is common in Surrey and needs specific care:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Re-sand after cleaning</strong> - Pressure washing removes jointing sand. Replace it or weeds return quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Consider sealing</strong> - Sealers protect colour, reduce staining, and slow weed growth</li>
                <li><strong>Spot treat oil stains</strong> - Address oil drips promptly before they set</li>
                <li><strong>Don't use too much pressure</strong> - High pressure dislodges sand and damages block edges</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When Your Driveway Needs Professional Attention</h2>

            <p>Call a professional if you notice:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Thick moss that's lifting blocks or filling joints</li>
                <li>Black spots that won't shift (lichen)</li>
                <li>Oil stains that have set in</li>
                <li>Render or walls turning green/black</li>
                <li>Slippery surfaces (safety hazard)</li>
                <li>You tried DIY and it looks patchy</li>
            </ul>
