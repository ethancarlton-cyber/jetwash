                    <h2>Professional Block Paving Restoration</h2>

                    <p>Block paving is extremely popular throughout Redhill, Reigate, Horley and Surrey, but it requires proper maintenance to look its best. Over time, block paved driveways and patios become dirty, stained, and overrun with weeds. Our professional block paving cleaning service restores the original appearance and protects your investment.</p>

                    <p>We specialize in cleaning all types of block paving including concrete blocks, clay pavers, and natural stone setts. Using professional equipment and the correct techniques, we remove stubborn stains, eliminate weeds, restore colour, and can re-sand and seal for long-lasting protection.</p>

                    <h2>Block Paving Services We Offer</h2>

                    <h3>Pressure Washing & Deep Cleaning</h3>
                    <p>Our core service removes dirt, moss, algae, oil stains, and general grime from block paving. We use controlled pressure settings that clean effectively without displacing the kiln sand between blocks or damaging the paver surface.</p>

                    <h3>Weed Removal</h3>
                    <p>Weeds growing between blocks create an unkempt appearance and can cause structural problems if left unchecked. Our pressure washing removes weeds and their roots from joints completely.</p>

                    <h3>Re-Sanding</h3>
                    <p>After cleaning, we can re-sand joints using quality kiln-dried sand. Proper sanding stabilizes the blocks, prevents weed growth, and improves drainage. We use weed-resistant jointing sand for enhanced protection.</p>

                    <h3>Sealing & Protection</h3>
                    <p>Block paving sealing provides multiple benefits: enhances colour, prevents staining, inhibits weed growth, and makes future cleaning easier. We use professional-grade sealants designed for block paving.</p>

                    <h2>Benefits of Professional Block Paving Cleaning</h2>

                    <h2>Common Block Paving Problems in Surrey</h2>

                    <p>Block paving in Redhill, Reigate and surrounding areas faces specific challenges:</p>

                    <ul class="problems-list">
                        <li><strong>Weed Growth</strong> - Seeds lodge in joints and grow rapidly, especially in summer</li>
                        <li><strong>Moss & Algae</strong> - Damp climate encourages green growth, creating slippery surfaces</li>
                        <li><strong>Sand Loss</strong> - Rain washes away jointing sand, destabilizing blocks</li>
                        <li><strong>Oil Stains</strong> - Vehicle leaks create dark patches on lighter coloured blocks</li>
                        <li><strong>Colour Fading</strong> - UV exposure and weathering dulls original colours</li>
                        <li><strong>General Dirt Accumulation</strong> - Traffic film and grime builds up over years</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Our comprehensive cleaning and restoration service addresses all these issues, returning your block paving to excellent condition.</p>
