                    <h2>Expert Render Cleaning & Soft Washing</h2>

                    <p>Rendered walls are prone to green algae growth and black staining, especially in Surrey's damp climate. Our professional render cleaning service uses soft washing techniques to safely remove all organic growth without damaging your render or forcing water into your walls.</p>

                    <p>Unlike high-pressure washing (which can damage render), soft washing uses low pressure combined with specialist cleaning solutions to kill algae, moss, and bacteria at the root. This provides longer-lasting results and protects your property.</p>

                    <h2>What is Soft Washing?</h2>

                    <p>Soft washing is a gentle cleaning method specifically designed for delicate surfaces like render, painted walls, and building facades. We use:</p>

                    <ul class="benefits-list">
                        <li><strong>Low Pressure Application</strong> - 10-20% of standard pressure washing force</li>
                        <li><strong>Specialist Biocides</strong> - Kill algae, moss, and lichen at root level</li>
                        <li><strong>Longer-Lasting Results</strong> - Treats the cause, not just the symptoms</li>
                        <li><strong>Safe for Render</strong> - No risk of damage or water ingress</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="before-after-section">
                        <h3>See the Difference</h3>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Render Types We Clean</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>K-Rend and modern acrylic renders</li>
                        <li>Traditional sand and cement render</li>
                        <li>Pebbledash and roughcast</li>
                        <li>Painted render</li>
                        <li>Monocouche render</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Common Render Problems</h2>

                    <h3>Green Algae Growth</h3>
                    <p>The most common issue in Surrey. Green algae (Gloeocapsa magma) thrives on north-facing and shaded walls, creating unsightly green or black streaks.</p>

                    <h3>Black Staining</h3>
                    <p>Dark streaks caused by algae, pollution, and organic matter. Particularly noticeable on white or light-coloured renders.</p>

                    <h3>Red Algae</h3>
                    <p>Less common but creates distinctive red/pink staining on render surfaces.</p>
