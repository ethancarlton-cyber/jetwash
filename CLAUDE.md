# JetWash Lead Generation Website - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

**Budget**: £0 - EVERYTHING MUST BE FREE. No spending until ROI achieved.

**Target Radius**: 20 miles from RH1 (Redhill/Reigate)

## IMPORTANT: Anonymous Lead-Gen Model

**This is NOT an actual jetwashing business.** This is an anonymous lead generation website.

### Constraints:
- ❌ **NO Google Business Profile** - Requires address verification, exposes identity
- ❌ **NO phone number** - Only form submissions wanted
- ❌ **NO personal information** - Remain fully anonymous
- ❌ **NO local business citations** - These require verification
- ✅ **Form submissions ONLY** - All leads via Web3Forms

### SEO Strategy (Content-Focused):
Since we can't use local business signals (GBP, NAP, citations), our strategy focuses on:
1. **Content marketing** - Blog articles targeting informational/commercial keywords
2. **On-page SEO** - Title tags, meta descriptions, internal linking
3. **Backlinks** - HARO, guest posts, Reddit/Quora (no personal info needed)
4. **Long-tail keywords** - "how much does X cost", "how often should I X"

### Keywords to Target (No Map Pack Trigger):
- "driveway cleaning cost UK"
- "patio cleaning prices"
- "how often clean driveway"
- "pressure washing vs jet washing"
- "is pressure washing worth it"
- "block paving cleaning cost"
- "best time to clean patio UK"

## Claude Code Agent Usage Guidelines

### Agent-First Approach for Context Management

**IMPORTANT**: When working on tasks for this project, Claude Code should prioritize using agents (via the Task tool) to maximize context efficiency and improve task execution.

**When to Use Agents:**
- **Exploration tasks**: Use `subagent_type=Explore` when searching the codebase, understanding architecture, or investigating multiple files
- **Research tasks**: Use `subagent_type=general-purpose` for multi-step research, documentation lookup, or information gathering
- **Planning tasks**: Use `subagent_type=Plan` for implementation strategy and architectural decisions
- **Parallel work**: Launch multiple agents in parallel when tasks are independent (use single message with multiple Task calls)

**Benefits of Agent Usage:**
- Better context compartmentalization - each agent focuses on a specific subtask
- Improved context management - agents work with isolated context windows
- Parallel processing - multiple agents can work simultaneously
- Cleaner main conversation - research/exploration details stay in agent context

**Example Scenarios:**
- ❌ Don't: Use Grep/Glob directly for open-ended codebase exploration
- ✅ Do: Use Task tool with Explore agent to investigate how features work
- ❌ Don't: Read multiple files sequentially to understand a system
- ✅ Do: Launch Explore agent to analyze the system architecture
- ❌ Don't: Manually search for documentation across multiple sources
- ✅ Do: Launch general-purpose agent to research and compile information

**Default Behavior:** When in doubt, prefer spawning an agent over doing the work directly in the main conversation. This keeps the main context clean and focused on high-level coordination.
