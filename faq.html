                <h2>Service & Process Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does pressure washing take?</h3>
                    <p>Typical timeframes for common jobs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Small driveway:</strong> 2-3 hours</li>
                        <li><strong>Large driveway:</strong> 3-4 hours</li>
                        <li><strong>Small patio:</strong> 1-2 hours</li>
                        <li><strong>Medium patio:</strong> 2-3 hours</li>
                        <li><strong>House render (3-bed semi):</strong> 3-5 hours</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Times vary based on size, condition, and whether stain pre-treatment is required. Heavily soiled surfaces or stubborn oil stains need additional time. We never rush jobs - quality results take proper time.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to be home during the work?</h3>
                    <p>Not necessarily. For external work like driveways and patios, you don't need to be present as long as we have access to the area and an outside water supply. Many customers leave us to work while they're at work. We'll discuss access requirements when providing your quote.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What happens to the dirty water?</h3>
                    <p>Dirty water typically drains away naturally into your existing drainage system, soakaway, or lawn areas. We ensure no pooling water is left and all debris is removed from the site. For areas with poor drainage, we discuss water management before starting work.</p>

                <h2>Technical & Safety Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does pressure washing damage concrete or paving?</h3>
                    <p>When done correctly by professionals, no. Pressure washing does not damage properly installed concrete or paving. The key is using appropriate pressure settings for each surface type:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Concrete:</strong> Can handle high pressure</li>
                        <li><strong>Block paving:</strong> Medium pressure to avoid displacing sand</li>
                        <li><strong>Natural stone:</strong> Lower pressure to preserve the stone</li>
                        <li><strong>Render:</strong> Soft washing techniques</li>
                        <li><strong>Tarmac:</strong> Carefully controlled pressure</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>DIY pressure washing with incorrect pressure or technique can cause damage. This is why professional service is recommended for valuable surfaces.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is pressure washing safe for block paving?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, block paving is designed to be pressure washed. We use appropriate pressure settings that clean effectively without displacing the kiln sand between blocks. After cleaning, we can re-sand joints if necessary and apply sealant to protect the surface and prevent weed growth.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you remove oil stains from driveways?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, in most cases. Oil stains are one of the most challenging driveway problems, but we use specialist degreasers and techniques to remove or significantly reduce oil staining. Very old, deep-set oil stains may not remove completely, but we can usually improve appearance by 80-90%. We'll be honest about expected results during the quote.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will pressure washing damage my plants?</h3>
                    <p>We take care to protect your plants and garden. We avoid direct spray on delicate plants, cover sensitive areas where needed, and rinse any splashed plants with fresh water. The cleaning solutions we use for standard jobs are generally plant-safe when diluted. For specialist chemicals, we take extra precautions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are you insured?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, we carry full public liability insurance for your peace of mind and property protection. This covers any unlikely damage to property during our work. We're happy to provide proof of insurance on request.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Timing & Scheduling Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you pressure wash in winter?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, pressure washing can be done throughout winter, weather permitting. We avoid working during freezing conditions as water can freeze on surfaces creating slip hazards and potential damage. Mild winter days (above 3°C) are actually ideal for pressure washing. Winter cleaning prevents moss and algae buildup during the wet season.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the best time of year to pressure wash a driveway?</h3>
                    <p>Pressure washing can be done year-round, but the best times are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Spring (March-May):</strong> Removes winter dirt and moss before summer entertaining</li>
                        <li><strong>Autumn (September-November):</strong> Removes summer algae growth and prepares for winter</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Avoid midwinter freezing periods and midsummer in direct heat (surfaces dry too quickly). The key is weather conditions on the day - we need temperatures above 3°C and no heavy rain forecast.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How often should you pressure wash your driveway?</h3>
                    <p>We recommend pressure washing driveways every 1-2 years for optimal maintenance. Factors affecting frequency:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Shaded driveways:</strong> Annual cleaning (more moss/algae)</li>
                        <li><strong>High traffic areas:</strong> Annual cleaning</li>
                        <li><strong>Sunny, well-drained driveways:</strong> Every 2 years sufficient</li>
                        <li><strong>Block paving:</strong> Annual cleaning recommended</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Regular maintenance is cheaper and easier than dealing with years of buildup. It also extends your driveway's lifespan significantly.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How quickly can you provide the service?</h3>
                    <p>We aim to provide quotes same-day and can often schedule work within 3-7 days depending on demand. During busy periods (spring/summer), booking may take 1-2 weeks. For urgent requirements, please mention this when requesting your quote and we'll prioritize where possible.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Specific Problem Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do you remove black spots from patios?</h3>
                    <p>Black spots on patios are typically caused by lichen (a fungus that embeds in stone). Our removal process:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Apply specialist biocide treatment to kill the lichen at root level</li>
                        <li>Allow treatment to work (15-30 minutes)</li>
                        <li>Pressure wash using appropriate settings for your patio material</li>
                        <li>Stubborn spots may need repeat treatment</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Black spot removal is very effective, though some ghosting may remain on very porous stones. We can discuss expected results during your quote. Learn more on our <a href="patio-cleaning.html">patio cleaning page</a>.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>My patio is slippery - can you help?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, slippery patios are a safety hazard we address regularly. Slippery surfaces are caused by algae growth, especially in shaded or damp areas. Our pressure washing removes all algae, moss, and organic matter, restoring grip to the surface. We can also apply anti-slip treatments for particularly problematic areas.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you clean green algae from rendered walls?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, we specialize in <a href="render-cleaning.html">render cleaning</a>. Green algae on render is common in Surrey due to our damp climate. We use soft washing techniques (low pressure with specialist cleaning solutions) to remove algae without damaging the render. This is much safer than high-pressure washing which can damage render and force water into your walls.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you remove weeds from block paving?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, weed removal from block paving joints is included in our <a href="block-paving-cleaning.html">block paving cleaning service</a>. The pressure washing process removes weeds and their roots from joints. We can then re-sand joints and apply weed-resistant jointing sand or sealant to prevent rapid regrowth.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Additional Services Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you offer sealing after pressure washing?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, we offer sealing services for driveways, patios, and block paving. Sealing after cleaning provides several benefits:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protects surfaces from staining and weathering</li>
                        <li>Enhances and maintains colour</li>
                        <li>Makes future cleaning easier</li>
                        <li>Prevents weed growth in joints (block paving)</li>
                        <li>Extends surface lifespan</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Sealing is quoted separately and should be done immediately after cleaning for best results.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you clean commercial properties?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, we provide <a href="commercial-jetwashing.html">commercial jetwashing services</a> for businesses, car parks, warehouse floors, shop fronts, and other commercial premises throughout Surrey.
