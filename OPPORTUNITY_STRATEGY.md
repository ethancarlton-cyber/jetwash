# Finding Software Opportunities No One Else Will Find

## The Problem with Standard Research

**Everyone searches the same way:**
1. Google "micro-SaaS ideas" or "underserved niches"
2. Read the same blog posts and listicles
3. Use Capterra, G2, Product Hunt to find competitors
4. Look at tech-adjacent markets (SaaS for SaaS)
5. Talk to other founders/developers

**Result:** Everyone finds the same "opportunities" which are already crowded.

## Strategy: Look Where Others Don't

### Principle 1: Search for Problems, Not Software

**Instead of:** "lawn care software"
**Search for:** "lawn care business nightmare" OR "worst part of lawn care" OR "lawn care paperwork sucks"

**Why:** People with real problems don't search for software - they complain about problems. Find the complaints, not the solutions.

**Where to search:**
- Reddit (r/[industry], r/smallbusiness)
- Facebook Groups (every hobby/job has one)
- Industry-specific forums (not tech forums)
- Quora, Yahoo Answers (older demographics)
- Local community groups (Nextdoor, Facebook local)

---

### Principle 2: Follow the Templates

**Key Insight:** When people sell Excel templates or Notion templates for something, that's a software opportunity. Templates = manual process that could be automated.

**Where to look:**
- Etsy (search "[industry] template" or "[hobby] spreadsheet")
- Gumroad (digital products = pain points)
- Notion template galleries
- Airtable universe
- Google Sheets template communities

**Examples:**
- "Wedding budget spreadsheet" templates → Wedding budget software
- "Inventory template for small business" → Inventory software
- "Homeschool curriculum tracker" → Homeschool software

---

### Principle 3: Find Offline-First People

**Tech people miss:** People who primarily work offline, with paper, or with basic tools.

**Target demographics:**
- Tradespeople (electricians, plumbers, carpenters) - already researched, crowded
- Farmers and agricultural workers
- Religious organizations (churches, mosques, temples)
- Local clubs and societies
- Seniors and retirees
- Blue-collar shift workers
- Artists and craftspeople (not "creators" - actual physical artists)

**How they find software:**
- Word of mouth in their community
- Facebook groups for their specific thing
- Trade associations and unions
- Physical trade shows and meetups
- NOT through Google or Product Hunt

---

### Principle 4: Geographic & Regulatory Gaps

**UK-Specific Opportunities:**
- HMRC Making Tax Digital compliance
- UK driving theory test prep
- UK rental laws (different from US)
- UK-specific certifications
- NHS-adjacent services (non-clinical)

**EU-Specific:**
- GDPR compliance tools for small businesses
- EU accessibility requirements (June 2025)
- Country-specific invoicing requirements

**Non-English Markets:**
- Software in German, Spanish, French often lags 5+ years
- Same opportunities, less competition
- Higher barriers to entry for competitors

---

### Principle 5: Life Events & Transitions

**People pay more during transitions:**
- Getting married (wedding planning)
- Having a baby (parenting tools)
- Buying a house (moving, renovation)
- Starting a business
- Retiring (estate planning, hobby time)
- Death in family (estate settlement)
- Divorce (asset division)
- Moving countries (immigration)

**Why this works:** Emotional + high-stakes = willingness to pay. One-time events = one-time purchases work.

---

### Principle 6: Look at What Broke

**Find things that used to work but stopped:**
- APIs that changed (Twitter, Reddit, etc.)
- Software that got acquired and ruined
- Free tools that became paid
- Services that shut down

**How to find:**
- "Alternative to [dead product]"
- "[Product] sucks now"
- "[Product] alternatives after [change]"
- Hacker News threads about product changes

---

### Principle 7: Physical + Digital Combos

**Hardware lock-in creates defensibility:**
- Raspberry Pi projects that need software
- Arduino/IoT monitoring tools
- QR code + software systems
- NFC tags + management
- Label printers + inventory systems

**Why:** Can't just copy the software - need the whole system.

---

### Principle 8: Counter-Position on Crowded Markets

**Instead of avoiding competition, find the angle no one serves:**

| Crowded Market | Underserved Angle |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Project management | Specific industry workflow |
| CRM | Specific sales process (e.g., art galleries) |
| Scheduling | Specific constraint (e.g., shift swaps only) |
| Invoicing | Specific billing model (e.g., retainers) |
| Email marketing | Specific use case (e.g., event reminders) |

## Research Methods

### Method 1: Community Immersion
1. Join 5-10 Facebook groups for non-tech industries
2. Lurk for 2 weeks, read all complaints
3. Note recurring problems
4. See what tools people recommend to each other

### Method 2: Template Mining
1. Search Etsy for "[industry] spreadsheet" or "[hobby] template"
2. Read reviews - what do people wish it did?
3. Best sellers = validated demand
4. Build software version

### Method 3: Reddit Deep Dive
1. Find subreddits for specific jobs/hobbies
2. Search "software" "app" "tool" "frustrating" "hate"
3. Look for threads with 100+ comments (real pain)
4. Note what people are using (spreadsheets = opportunity)

### Method 4: Trade Publication Research
1. Find trade magazines for specific industries
2. Look at their "technology" or "software" sections
3. Often years behind - shows what's actually used
4. Advertised products = incumbents to study

### Method 5: Local Business Walk-Through
1. Visit local businesses (not chains)
2. Observe what technology they use
3. Ask owners about their biggest headaches
4. Often using paper, old software, or nothing

## Next Steps

1. **Pick 3-5 categories** from above that interest you
2. **Find the communities** where these people hang out

4. **Identify the #1 complaint** that involves manual/paper processes
5. **Validate with 5 conversations** before building anything

*The best opportunity is one you find by talking to people, not by Googling.*
