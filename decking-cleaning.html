                    <h2>Expert Decking Restoration</h2>

                    <p>Garden decking requires regular maintenance to stay safe and attractive. In Surrey's damp climate, decking quickly becomes covered in slippery green algae, moss, and dirt. Our professional decking cleaning service removes all organic growth, restores the wood's natural colour, and makes your outdoor space safe and beautiful again.</p>

                    <p>We clean both wooden decking (softwood and hardwood) and composite decking materials using appropriate pressure settings and techniques for each type.</p>

                    <h2>Benefits of Professional Decking Cleaning</h2>

                    <ul class="benefits-list">

                        <li><strong>Restore Colour</strong> - Bring back natural wood tones or composite colour</li>

                    <h2>Decking Types We Clean</h2>

                    <h3>Softwood Decking</h3>
                    <p>Most common type in UK gardens. Requires careful pressure washing to avoid damaging the softer wood. We restore the golden/honey colour and can prepare for oiling.</p>

                    <h3>Hardwood Decking</h3>
                    <p>Oak, Iroko, and tropical hardwoods require specialist care. We use appropriate pressure to clean without damaging the dense wood grain.</p>

                    <h3>Composite Decking</h3>
                    <p>Modern composite decking (plastic/wood blend) is low-maintenance but still needs periodic cleaning. We use gentle pressure to avoid surface damage.</p>

                    <h2>Our Decking Cleaning Process</h2>

                    <div class="process-steps">

                        <div class="step">

                        <div class="step">
                            <h3>3. Pre-Treatment</h3>
                            <p>Apply specialist deck cleaner to break down organic growth and embedded dirt.</p>
                        </div>
